Some argue it should be decriminalized, while others want to put a limit on how much a person can grow in a given space, or how much a person can smoke in one day.</p> <p>As it turns out — though it's far from certain — there's a lot of precedent for the debate to be settled, in a way that may be impossible to predict. That precedent comes to us from Washington.</p> <p>(1)</p> <p>The federal government's prohibition on marijuana in 1937. That's the legal height of its enforcement and enforcement was fairly severe. Over the next several decades, some of the first major marijuana-related arrests, prosecutions and convictions occurred throughout the country. In the early- to mid-20th century, the federal government seized tens of millions of dollars worth of marijuana and hundreds of millions of dollars more — sometimes in cash, other times in jewelry, food, automobiles or land — as collateral for loans, bonds or real estate. In the early- to mid-20th century, some of the first major marijuana-related arrests, prosecutions and convictions occurred throughout the country. In the early-to mid-20th century, some of the first major marijuana-related arrests, prosecutions and convictions occurred throughout the country. In the early- to mid-20th century, most of the federal restrictions on marijuana went into effect in the early- to mid-1930s. Some, though not all, of those restrictions were applied in Washington.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/us-canada-marijuana-idUSKBN0EY10L20130902</a></p> <p>A little more than a century earlier, the United States had already gone down that route — with the passage in 1937 of a sweeping Act known as the Marijuana Tax Act. Its purpose was to prohibit the production, trafficking in, possession and retail sale of marijuana. But many, many politicians considered the act's effects on a state's economy and health a serious problem. In an effort to combat the growing concern for economic and health harm that the act was causing throughout the country, the U.S. Congress enacted laws regulating marijuana. This period, during which some states experimented with marijuana legalization — with various legalization schemes in various forms — created an open conversation of what the federal government's reach should be. This would eventually lead to the federal government's decision in 1968 to create the Controlled Substances Act.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpost/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/02/AR2007082183423.html\">'The War on Marijuana': The Marijuana War Begins</a></p> <\n",

            "[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And, yeah, that is really the case. There's a lot of reasons for it. And obviously, if there is a major event like the election or if there is a major change that it brings, that will impact your life, your career path, or your day job, this is when you have to prepare for those things.\n",

Is it not how big of a deal there will be, or the consequences that they'll face? It's always like that. What can I do today in my business and my work that, let's say, someone in the United States or the world wants? Is it the right, like, what I did today to do? And, like, what would I be doing? Is it a good use of my time, or how important is my career and how important is my relationship with everybody?\n",

            "[INPUT]: No, it's more that you just have to prepare for it. You have to be prepared for everything. It's, like, like, if you've gone to the gym, and you've gone to the diet, you've gone to the fitness regimen, if there's a major change here, you've done your job. You've covered all of the bases. You're just kind of dealing with it now. I mean, right now is a big part of it and it's the transition to you know.

You're trying to sort of figure it out.\n",
            "\n",
            "[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, you look at, like, how things affect certain people in certain situations. Like you know, sometimes, you have a friend in the business or a partner that you care about. They'll have an important relationship. Like, I lost touch with them and they're, like, still really important to me, but in this new business environment, they're not on the same level.\n",

            "[Joe Rogan]: Right.\n",
            "\n",

Everybody has the same idea, right? Everybody's, like, they're thinking the same way, so, you know, I'm not doing anything different.\n",

What's the last problem in your life? Why was the last problem bad, did you have other problems? And so on. So, it's a -- like you think, there's a certain mindset. You want to have that right mindset. But, like, some people, like, they have, like, a particular mindset.\n",
