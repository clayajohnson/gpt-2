"[Joe Rogan]: This is live ladies and gentlemen, and this is a very unusual podcast we’re going to have here and a very unusual discussion. I have to my left, Michael Shermer, a very famous skeptic. He’s been on the podcast before.Of course, Randall Carlson, amazing gentleman who knows far too much about terrifying things like asteroids, and Graham Hancock, author, also a fantastic human being.Many times been on this podcast as well. This all came out of a podcast that Randall and Graham and I did recently, and Michael Shermer commented on it. It was all essentially on the hypothesis that the great extinction that happened with the North American land animals, that happened somewhere around the end of the ice age, was caused by a common impact.Michael Shermer had some questions about that and we said this would be an amazing podcast to get everybody together in a room and go over this. Since then, there’s been some interesting stuff that’s happened.I thought this was really fascinating, that Forbes has a mainstream article in Forbes, ‘Did A Comet Wipe Out Ice Age Megafauna?’This is actually from just a couple of weeks ago. Then there was also this interpretation that’s fairly recent as well, about one of the stone carvings rather, on Gobekli Tepe.Graham, you would probably be the best to describe that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. That was published in Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry, Peer Review Journal, by a couple of scientists from the University of Edinburgh. They are proposing an interpretation of the Gobekli Tepe imagery, there’s quite a lot of imagery on those t-shaped pillars, particularly one pillar, pillar 43 and enclosure D.Their deduction, what they take from their interpretation, of course many will disagree with them, their interpretation is that those images are speaking of the comet impact. They’re speaking of a comet that hit the earth roughly 12,900 years before our time."
"[Joe Rogan]: Randall, this has been something that you’ve been obsessed with for many years now. You’ve documented and detailed it in many conversations that we’ve had on the podcast."
[INPUT]: Yes. I can’t say that I’m that familiar with that article. I haven’t had a chance to get into.
"[Joe Rogan]: But this idea, the comet impact is what has caused the end of the ice age."
"[INPUT]: Well, it’s so complex, but now what we do is we throw some type of an impact into the mix and it seems to fill gaps that have —"
[Joe Rogan]: Pull this right up to you.
"[INPUT]: It seems to fill gaps that were, at this point, still unexplained. There’s varying theories between some extent of climate change and some extent of human predation that cause the extinction. I’ve always felt like you can’t blame it on one or the other."
"[INPUT]: 03It seems that most of the extinctions did occur between roughly 13,000 and 11,600 years ago, although the dating has a wide spread on it, so you can’t pin point it down to a specific event. I’ve always felt that there had to be something we needed to look at that triggered the extreme climate changes that we do at the end of the ice age.To my opinion, you can’t attribute that solely to Milakovitch Theory, which is basically the changing solar terrestrial geometries, because they’re too slow, and what we see at the end of the ice age were very rapid climate changes. One of the things that I think as been missing, has been the trigger."
"[INPUT]: 04But now I think that the dating of the draining of Lake Agassiz is too late for that and was probably a ladder event within the overall melting phenomenon that occurred between roughly 14,600 and about 11,000 years ago.Somewhere in there, we have to fit that mass extinction event. I definitely have thought that climate change was the dominant factor in that, but then what triggered the climate change? That always seemed to me to be something that was not ever really explained. The comet impact theory is very controversial but the evidence has been steadily mounting now for a decade."
"[Joe Rogan]: Including physical evidence, right? Like the core samples that show nuclear glass scattered out throughout Asia and Europe at roughly the same time period when they do the core samples?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. Most of it’s dating to 12,800 to 13,000 years ago."
[INPUT]: These are called impact proxies.
[INPUT]: Impact proxies..
"[INPUT]: Nano diamonds, melt glass, micro spherules. These kind of things are associated with impact. Not necessarily always caused by impact, so this has been part of the reason for the controversy, but it’s the abundance of all of these, at a particular level, which leads a large group of scientists to feel that we have had a comet impact in the past."
[INPUT]: It’s the full assemblage of things that is difficult to explain by processes without invoking some type of a cosmic event.
[Joe Rogan]: It also corresponds with what you believe is a period where earth travels through a series of comets.
"[INPUT]: This gets us to the ideas of what would be called the British Neo-catastrophes. Victor Clube and William Napier and a number of others that have theorized that from time to time, earth encounters the debrief from a large disintegrating comet.William Napier addresses this in an interesting article I can pull up here pretty soon, that possibly, around 13,000 years ago, earth may have encountered some of the debrief from a disintegrating comet, which ultimately goes back to Fred Whipple, who’s one of the godfathers of cometary science."
"[INPUT]: Could I just come in on that for a second? Specifically Bill Napier, Victor Clube, are identifying the remnants of this comet, with the torrid meteor stream, which is familiar I think to everybody. We pass through it twice a year, we see meteoroids, particularly end of October, early November. That debris stream is still there."
[INPUT]: 07
"[INPUT]: Michael, when you listened to that podcast, you had some questions. You are a professional skeptic so of course you were skeptical. What are your thoughts about all this?"
"[INPUT]: Let me pull back and give it a bigger picture. After the podcast, I went and got the book, Magicians Of The Gods. Actually, I listened to it on audio, so it’s like 16–18 hours of Graham reading with his wonderful British accent, which is, you know, for Americans, that elevates the quality of the argument by an order of magnitude."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. That’s how they sell things in infomercials over here.
"[INPUT]: Graham, you’re a good writer. It’s a very compelling story."
[INPUT]: Thank you. You’re a great skeptic.
"[INPUT]: A number of points about in general, the idea of alternative archaeology, which is really what we’re talking about here. I prefer that to pseudo archaeology, because that’s a little bit of… It’s supposed to be a little bit of an insult. Alternative archaeology, it’s good to remember that… You have these guys on the podcast for three or four hours, and the audience listening thinks, “Yeah, why don’t these guys get a fair hearing.” It’s like there’s the mainstream and then there’s these guys, but there isn’t just these guys. There’s hundreds of alternative archaeological theories.Which one gets the play, which one gets attention, which one doesn’t? For a mainstream archaeologist who’s busy in the field and trying to get grants and so on, they mostly just don’t have the time to sort through all these alternative theories, because this is just one, and as we’ll see in the next couple of hours, there’s hundreds and hundreds of things to be addressed. That’s kind of what we do.Just to rattle off a few, The Lost Tribes of Israel Colonized Who the Americans. Mormon archaeology explanation of Native Americans. The Kennsington Runestones of Minnesota, that the vikings had come here. The Black Egyptian hypothesis. When I was in graduate school, this book called Black Athena was published, that Egyptians were actually Black and that the western White, male dominance of history has written them out of the path."
"[INPUT]: 10The way it works in science is the default position is the skeptical position. We assume your hypothesis is not true, not just you, anybody’s hypothesis, like the Clube Napier hypothesis. That was widely published. It was widely covered in mainstream scientific journals and popular science magazines like Scientific American, and it has not fared i that well over the last decade or so.It’s still around. It’s still debated. You put it in the mainstream through peer review journals, and then you go to conferences and you have it out, and that’s kind of where we end up with, “This is what we think is probably true for now,” and then all these other people out here, if they don’t jump in into the pool where everybody is, then there’s no way for an outsider to know whether these alternative things have any validity or not, other than they make a compelling case in a popular book, yes, but what do the mainstream scientists think?The problem is that, a couple of specific things like what I call patternicity, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise. The virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich or whatever. Those are fun examples, but taking petroglyphs and then comparing them to constellations like, “Here, we have some constellations on your roof here.” It’s easy in the mind’s eye to find a pattern.The question is, did those people really think, ten thousand years ago, five thousand years. This is a field called archaeo-astronomy. Ed Krupp, the director of The Griffith Observatory here in LA, this what he does. Sometimes the patterns, he thinks the patterns mean something, sometimes they’re totally random.Or take something like the pyramids. As Graham knows, there’s 100 theories about the pyramids. There’s the mainstream one and then there’s all these other ones. This is why people like the director there, he just can’t deal with them all. Just this one example I used in my book, Why People Believe Weird things, that one guy calculated that if you divide the height of the pyramid into twice the side of the base, you get the number close to pie. Then he just sort of works all these different numbers so therefore it’s cosmically significant."
"[Joe Rogan]: Richard Hogan was the best example in that, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yes, Hogan."
[Joe Rogan]: He would find these patterns in Mars and claim if you go from this rock to half the distance… Why would you do that? That doesn’t make any sense. He would create these patterns to make his case.
"[INPUT]: Right, and that’s okay. All scientists look for patterns. Like just take climate change. Either the earth is getting warmer or it’s not. Either it’s human caused or it’s not. There’s a pattern in the data. You can see the pattern. The question is, is the pattern real? This is why we use the term climate consensus.It’s not a democracy, it’s not like we voted on it and decided this is the truth, it’s that independently, all these different scientist working in different fields, publishing in different journals, come to the same conclusion.We call this consilience science or convergence of evidence science, that it’s not like these guys are meeting on the weekends going, “Boy, we’ve got to combat those crazy right wingers with our data. They’re independently coming to these conclusions. That lifts our confidence that, yeah, there’s probably something to their theory, such that there’s now so much data converging to this, you’d have to deconstruct every one of those independent lines.Then you have things like, what I call “the problem of the residue of anomalies”. In any field, there are residue of anomalies we can’t explain. Like UFOs for example. UF-ologist and me, a skeptic, agree that 90–95% of all the UFO sightings are explained by natural phenomenon. Venus, swamp gas, airplanes, geese, whatever.They know that, so we’re really only talking about 5%. How do you explain that one right there, 1967 on June 3rd. I don’t know. No one knows that one. Then from there, they build, “That’s my case then. If you can’t explain that, then I have a case.” No."
"[Joe Rogan]: That’s very different than what we’re talking about here though, right?"
[INPUT]: How is that relevant to us here?
"[INPUT]: It’s totally relevant because I think almost all of your argument is based on this residue of anomalies. What we call the god of the gaps argument. If you scientists can’t explain this particular rock right here or that particular petroglyph, I’m going to count that toward my compilation of data to support my hypothesis of a lost civilization."
"[Joe Rogan]: But no one is saying that the scientists can’t explain it. What essentially, particularly Randall, with the series of images that’s shown, is that what you have here is something that can be explained by rapid melting of the ice caps. Randall, step in, if you will. Okay, go ahead if you want."
"[INPUT]: Depends on what you mean by rapid. A glacial dam that as archaeologists will tell us in a moment, that breaks, that’s fairly rapid. Back in ’96, there was a very popular book called ‘The Noah’s Flood’. This was a serious book by two geologists that said it was the rapid filling up of the Black Sea, that swamped over the civilizations living on the edges of this, and that’s where the Noah Arkian story comes from.It was widely debated and it hasn’t fared that well, but that’s fairly rapid. We’re talking over the course of weeks or months or years. To a geologist, thousands of years is rapid. An impact by a comet that happens in a couple of hours or couple of days or weeks, versus a couple of months or years, what do we mean by rapid?"
[Joe Rogan]: But what are you saying then? What are you saying about their theories in particular?
"[INPUT]: The problem I think, Graham, the deepest problem is much of your theory depends on negative evidence, that is, I don’t accept the mainstream explanation for the pyramids, the sphinx, the Machu Picchu, whatever."
"[Joe Rogan]: Let’s not talk about that. Let’s just talk about this specific subject, because it’s going to take a long time just to cover asteroidal impact. My final point is the falsifiability one, that is, what would it take to refute your hypothesis?For me, the answer would be like if Gobekli Tepe turned out to be what you think it might have been, the place where advanced age and civilization once inhabited or they used it. Where are the metal tools? Where are the examples of writing?"
"[INPUT]: Perhaps a decision was made not to use metal. Perhaps a decision was made that errors had taken place, that in re-inventing civilization, we shouldn’t perhaps go down quite the same route as before. Perhaps writing isn’t always an advance. Perhaps an oral tradition which records in memory, which enhances and uses the power of memory, may be a very effective way of dealing with information. We regard writing as an advance and I can see from lots of reasons, why it is an advance, but if we put ourselves into the heads of ancient peoples, maybe it wasn’t.There’s a tradition from ancient Egypt that the god Thoth, the god of wisdom, was the inventor of writing, but we have a text in which he is questioned by a pharaoh, who is saying, “Well, actually, have you really done a good thing by introducing writing, because then, the words may roam around the world without wise advice to put them into context and what will happen to memory when people… There might be a choice not to go that way."
"[INPUT]: Okay. All right. But then what do you mean by advance when you say there used to be a lost advance civilization before 10,000 years ago. What do you mean —"
"[Joe Rogan]: Let’s just pause here for a second because what we know for a fact is that the carbon dating in all the area around Gobekli Tepe, is somewhere around 12,000 years. Is that correct?"
"[INPUT]: 11,600 years ago is the earliest they found so far. The great deal of Gobekli Tepe is still underground."
"[Joe Rogan]: At least what we know is someone built some pretty impressive structures 11,600 years ago."
[INPUT]: Yeah. 7000 years before Stonehenge.
"[INPUT]: When that story broke, this is long before you came along with your book, it was controversial in the sense that we thought hunter gatherers could not do something like this because to do that, you need a large population with the division of labor and so forth and what the response to archaeologists was, “Well, I guess we were wrong about hunter gatherers.Maybe they can do more stuff than we gave them credit for.” Why is that not a reasonable hypothesis, versus it was actually advanced, but we mean something completely different by advanced. Not writing, and metal and technology, we mean… I don’t know what you mean. What do you mean?"
"[INPUT]: We have a body of archaeology which goes on for decades, which is saying that megalithic sites, for example Ġgantija, in Malta or Hagar Qin and Mnajdra, megalithic sites date to no older than five and a half to six thousand years old. Ġgantija would push it close to 6000 years old. There are no older sites than that and therefore the megalithic site is associated with a certain stage of neolithic development.Then along comes Gobekli Tepe, 7,000 years older than Stonehenge Incredible sophisticated site. Very large scale. Klaus Schmidt, sadly he’s passed away, I spent three days working the site with him. He was very generous to me. He showed me a lot. He talked to me a lot and he said, basically, 50 times as much as they’ve already excavated is still under the ground, that there’s hundreds and hundreds of giant stone pillars that they’ve identified with ground penetrating radar.He’s not even sure if they’re going to excavate them, but by all accounts, we are looking, if we take what’s still under the ground into account, we’re looking at the largest megalithic site that’s ever been created on earth. It pops up 11,600 years ago with no obvious background to it. It just comes out of nowhere that we know of.To me, that’s immediately a rather puzzling and interesting situation, and I would be remiss as an author and an inquirer into these matters, if I didn’t take great interest in that. The sudden appearance, 7,000 years before Stonehenge, of a megalithic site that dwarfs Stonehenge, to me, that’s a mystery and it’s really worth inquiring into."
"[Joe Rogan]: We love to put into perspective. That’s more than 2,000 years older than what we now consider to be the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza, in comparison to us to then. Between our time now in 2017, and the construction of the Great Pyramid, you’re talking about 2,000 years earlier than that, and that is unbelievable. When you’re talking about 7,000 years before what we thought people were doing."
"[INPUT]: My point was that, before we go down the road of constructing a lost civilization that was super advanced but different from our idea of events, why not just attribute to these fully modern, hunter gatherers who had the same size brains we have and so on, that they were able to figure out and do this. We just under-estimated their abilities."
"[INPUT]: Why did archaeologists tell us for so long hunter gatherers couldn’t do it and we needed agricultural populations that could generate surpluses, that could pay for the specialists to —"
"[INPUT]: Yes, that was the theory. Now what archaeologists are saying is, “I guess we were wrong about hunter gatherers.”"
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, they might be wrong about hunter gatherers, or there might be another civilization that they had not discovered, that has been on earth by time. We’re talking about so much time."
"[INPUT]: Sorry, Michael. Lost civilizations are not such an extraordinary idea. Nobody knew that the Indus Valley civilization existed at all until some railway work was done around [Noe Jadaro 00The idea that we come across, that another turn of the spade reveals information that causes us to reconsider not just was it hunter gatherers or agriculturalists, but perhaps something bigger than this is involved."
[INPUT]: Or in between that.
"[INPUT]: That’s not such an extraordinary idea. I get it that mainstream archaeology doesn’t want to go there, but that’s my job to go there."
"[INPUT]: No, I don’t think that that’s correct. They would be happy to go there if there’s evidence for it. By what you just said, they now fully accept the Indus Valley civilizations. How did that happen if they were dogmatically close-minded?"
"[INPUT]: I don’t say that they were dogmatically close-minded about that. The evidence, the massive amount of evidence that came up with the discovery of Mnajdra, Harappa, Dholavira and other such sites, is very difficult.You have to be completely stupid to say that that’s not a civilization. Gobekli Tepe is a bit more nuanced. We have stone circles. We have some interesting astronomical alignments. The world’s first perfectly north-south aligned building."
[INPUT]: Maybe.
"[INPUT]: No, definitely."
"[INPUT]: Again, that’s a patternicity thing."
"[INPUT]: I’m citing Klaus Schmidt, you know?"
"[INPUT]: That’s all right, but any of us who read back into history, 10,000 years ago, what we’re thinking, that they might have been thinking, that always a dangerous for anybody, not just you, all of us —"
[Joe Rogan]: That’s a good point. Who’s Klaus Schmidt?
"[INPUT]: Klaus Schmidt was the original excavator of Gobekli Tepe. He was the head of the German Archaeological Institute dig at Gobeklie Tepe. He kindly spent three days showing me around the site, and really, nobody is disputing the astronomical alignments of Gobekli Tepe. They weren’t particularly interesting to Klaus Schmidt, but they’re there."
[Joe Rogan]: What is the alignment? How was it established?
"[INPUT]: When you have a perfectly north-south aligned structure, perfectly north-south, to true north, not magnetic north, then you are dealing with astronomy, by definition. There are other alignments of the sun —"
[Joe Rogan]: True north as established today or with the procession of the equinox as we were talking about?
[INPUT]: True north is always true north. It’s the rotation axis of our planet.
"[Joe Rogan]: So to this day, it points exactly in the same place where it was pointing?"
"[INPUT]: It always points to true north, yeah."
"[INPUT]: Back to this, they don’t want to go? Sure, they want to go there. They would be happy to go there. Case in point, two weeks ago in the journal Nature, the most prestigious scientific journal in the world, there was published an article that humans or maybe Neanderthals, lived in San Diego area, 130,000 years ago. This is an order of magnitude older than the clove estate."
[Joe Rogan]: This was the Macedon bones they found that were smashed they believed —
"[INPUT]: Macedon bones, yeah. Clearly, there’s not some conspiracy to keep alternative people or fringe or radical theories out. It was published and peer reviewed, the most prestigious journal in the world. There it is, two weeks ago."
[INPUT]: Then what happened? Hasn’t there been a massive reaction to that and lots of scaving remarks by other academics.
"[INPUT]: Yes, but that’s normal. That’s how science works. You get pushed back. You’ve got to have a thick skin. It’s just the way it goes."
"[INPUT]: You’ve got to have a thick skin, that’s for sure, but maybe sometimes your skin is so thick that you just can’t sense anything around you."
[INPUT]: Of course we don’t want that either.
"[Joe Rogan]: So what do you think is going on? When you look at something like Gobekli Tepe that’s covered up purposefully, right? 12,000 years ago."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, deliberately buried. Again, I cite Klaus Schmidt, he’s the authority on this. He’s the excavator. He absolutely adamantly insists that that site was deliberately buried and finally covered with a hill, which is what Gobekli Tepe means in the Turkish language, pot belly tail."
"[Joe Rogan]: You were talking about something. Give me the perspective of how large they believe it is currently, as of current."
[INPUT]: What’s excavated at the moment is on a scale on Stonehenge. What’s under the ground may be as much as 50 times larger.
[Joe Rogan]: Jesus!
"[INPUT]: Gobekli Tepe, no one lived there. There’s no tools, there’s no…"
"[Joe Rogan]: You’re talking about 12,000 years old."
"[INPUT]: But if it’s buried, there should be pottery. There’s no pottery, no writing, no articles of clothing, no one lived there."
"[INPUT]: You’re saying nobody lived there, why should they have pottery? Why should pottery be in the field? Why would they go along and break some pots and stick in the artificial fill."
"[INPUT]: How about something, their trash, something that would indicate it’s different, a different kind of people than what we’re used to seeing in the archaeological record. In other words —"
[INPUT]: It was just rubbish that they poured in. It’s just stones and earth. Buckets of it.
"[INPUT]: In other words Graham, for you to gain support for your theory amongst mainstream archaeologists, they want to see positive evidence to overturn the old theory. In other words, the burden of proof is on the person challenging the mainstream, in every field."
[INPUT]: I completely agree.
"[Joe Rogan]: But isn’t there some proof that the mainstream idea of these hunter and gatherers, never had anything in what the theory was, that would indicate these people were capable of building something even remotely the size of Gobekli Tepe?"
"[INPUT]: To me, that’s the stunning beauty of this find. It overturns our ideas of primitive hunter gatherers that could not do this. Apparently, they can."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s one possible assessment.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that’s right. I call this, somebody else called this, the bigotry of low expectations. We had these low expectations for these hunter gatherers. Maybe we should Jetterson that idea. In my own other field of history of religion, it also threw that off, because this apparently was kind of a spiritual-religious, that’s the wrong word they would have used —"
"[INPUT]: Actually, nobody can know that."
"[INPUT]: That’s right. But if it was, this is the big national geographic article emphasized that, maybe this is the very first religious spiritual temple ever build, because they didn’t live there, so they went there for a reason."
"[Joe Rogan]: Isn’t it also possible that this is signs that civilization was more advanced 12,000 ago, than we thought?"
"[INPUT]: More advanced, again, what do we mean by advanced?"
[Joe Rogan]: We’re talking about the ability to construct an amazing structure. How big was it? How tall were these stones?
"[INPUT]: Some of them are 20 feet tall. Some of them are smaller, with astronomical alignments. Klaus Schmidt called it a center of innovation. He was intrigued by the way that agriculture emerges around Gobekli Tepe at the same time that Gobekli ,Tepe is created. He went on record with me, perhaps he’s not right, but he went on record with me as saying, that was the first agriculture.These were the people who invented agriculture. To me, the notion that a group of hunter gatherers wake up one morning and invent megalithic architecture, the world’s largest megalithic site, and at the same moment, invent agriculture, stretches credulity a bit, and I think I would prefer to propose and I have proposed, that what we’re looking at is evidence of some kind of transfer of technology, that people came into that area, who had other knowledge, and that was a plight and perhaps they mobilized the local population around this site. Perhaps that’s precisely why we see agriculture developing there. Perhaps that’s the skill that’s being passed on."
"[INPUT]: The stone work is spectacular, but that’s not any more advanced than a few millenniums afterwards."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you’re talking about something 20 feet tall, made of stone, but people that were hunter gatherers?"
[INPUT]: But a couple of hundred people can move multi-tone stones.
[INPUT]: There’s no mystery in moving the stones. They’re still moving 20-tonne stones in Indonesia today. Megalithic culture still exists.
[Joe Rogan]: You also know that the carving on the outside is extremely complex. It’s three dimensional carving. But do you know what that means?
"[INPUT]: But Lascaux at 30,000 years ago has magnificent cave paintings with three dimensional animals."
[Joe Rogan]: But that’s painting. Hold on a second. Do you know what I’m saying when I say three dimensional carvings?
[INPUT]: Like the venus.
"[Joe Rogan]: No. The carvings were on the outside, meaning they didn’t carve them into the rock, they carved away the rock around them, which is pretty sophisticated stuff for hunter gatherers, and they’re doing this on these 20 foot tall stone columns. It’s pretty impressive stuff."
"[INPUT]: But there the assumption is that they couldn’t have figured this out. We know from modern societies, where say Australian Aborigines, in one generation, they go from stone tools to flying airplanes. The brains are quite capable of doing these amazing things."
[INPUT]: Did they go from stone tools to flying airplanes without somebody introducing them to airplanes?
[Joe Rogan]: Exactly. You’re actually making his argument for him.
[INPUT]: No. It’s not that much of a reach to carve stone. People have been carving stones —
"[INPUT]: But the entire archaeological opinion on megalithic sites, for decades before this, was precisely that it was beyond their ability to do that."
"[INPUT]: Right, and now, the mainstream is changing or at the very least —"
[INPUT]: A little shift.
"[Joe Rogan]: Let’s pause for a moment. Let’s pause for a moment. For sure, we all agree, human beings made this?"
"[INPUT]: Yes, not aliens."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Even he rejects the aliens.
"[Joe Rogan]: The argument is not whether or not aliens made it, the argument is whether or not humans made it, that were sophisticated. They were clearly sophisticated enough to make this incredible structure that is some sign of some sort of civilization."
[INPUT]: I believe so.
[Joe Rogan]: It is. It’s a gigantic structure.
"[INPUT]: Here I agree with Graham, that we’ve undersold who these people were. My friend Jerry Diamond goes to Papua New Guinea. He talks in the opening chapter of Guns, Germs and Steel, how smart these people are, that live out there in nature and what it takes to survive. He wouldn’t last an hour from LA. He wouldn’t last an hour with his Papua New Guinean friends out there in the wild."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s just because he doesn’t know how to survive and they’ve been passing down the information for generation after generation.
"[INPUT]: That’s right. They’re very smart. It’s not a problem of intelligence. Here’s the other thing we don’t know, is that there might be lots more of these sites and where there’s —"
"[INPUT]: There are. I visited one of them, Karahan Tepe. You’ve the t-shaped pillars sticking out the side of a hill in a farmer’s backyard. I think we’re actually at the beginning of opening up this inquiry, not at the end of it, by any means."
"[INPUT]: Why not just say, “We don’t know. This is a spectacular mystery,” and leave it at that. Why write a book that say, “I’m going to fill in all the gaps.”"
"[INPUT]: You guys on the mainstream side won’t speculate and won’t explore. I don’t claim to be an archaeologist. I’m not a scientist. I’m an author. It’s my job to offer an alternative point of view and to offer a coherently argued alternative point of view, and I must say, Gobekli Tepe strikes me as a gigantic fucking mystery. A mystery that is worthy of exploration from a point of view that may not satisfy you."
[INPUT]: You don’t have to satisfy me.
"[INPUT]: You and your colleagues, and I certainly don’t have to satisfy you or them. That’s not my project."
"[INPUT]: Your opening chapter with Schmidt, I thought I really loved the kind of conversational style you had with Schmidt in the book, where he’s dialoguing, where Schmidt goes, “Look at this,” and then he says, “But wait, what’s that again?” It’s a little bit like Colombia, like, “Wait, I have just one more question.Just one more question.” That mystery thickens. That’s perfectly okay. That’s great. That’s what science is all about, is uncovering mysteries that we then have to figure out, so there’s always more mysteries, but that doesn’t mean, that’s not positive evidence in favor of a particular theory like a lost civilization. It’s just, we can’t explain this. Full stop."
[Joe Rogan]: We certainly can’t explain it and you can’t explain it by saying that we underestimated hunter and gatherers either?
[INPUT]: Why not? We know they made it. Whatever you want to call them.
[Joe Rogan]: We know humans made it.
[INPUT]: That’s right. We know humans made it. Whatever you want to call them.
"[Joe Rogan]: But why do they believe that people were only hunters and gatherers 12,000 years ago? It’s because they didn’t have any evidence to the contrary. This is evidence to the contrary."
[INPUT]: Right. I agree.
[Joe Rogan]: You agree that they weren’t hunters and gatherers?
[INPUT]: There’s several stages in between. 12 people living out in the jungle by themselves versus us. There’s like a whole bunch of different —
[Joe Rogan]: I would say that Gobekli Tepe is a gigantic stage.
[INPUT]: They didn’t live there so we have to figure out where were they living and what was there? That has to be excavated.
"[Joe Rogan]: They’ve only excavated 10% of it, right?"
"[INPUT]: Meanwhile, what you’re saying is we shouldn’t speculate at all, because mainstream archaeology’s speculating."
[INPUT]: Speculating is perfectly okay.
[INPUT]: Mainstream archaeology is speculating when saying it definitely was hunter gatherers who did this. That’s also a speculation.
[Joe Rogan]: That seems more of a reach.
[INPUT]: They may be more than hunter gatherers. They may have been partially settled. You can have any kind of number of stakes —
[INPUT]: But what you can’t apparently have is the possibility of a transfer of technology from people who were really masters of that technology when they came in?
[INPUT]: But where are these people? Where were their homes?
"[INPUT]: 12,000 years ago, their finger prints are there. Let’s find their homes. I don’t know that their homes matter. Would their homes even survive after 12,000 years? I’m not sure."
"[INPUT]: What homes? Their trash, their tools, their something."
[INPUT]: Screw trash and tools. We’ve got Gobekli Tepe. It confronts us. It challenges the mainstream model. I think it’s reasonable to consider the possibility that there was something more than just hunter gatherers involved here in creating thin extraordinary place. That’s all I’ve done.
"[INPUT]: It seems to me that to say hunter gatherers could build this, wouldn’t be a posy idea that they’re hunting and gathering, but it does certainly imply a lot of leisure time. A lot of leisure time.Again, if we place this back, particularly within that climate zone, at 11,000, 6–12,000, 13,000 years ago, whatever it turns out to be, we’re dealing with an extremely demanding and challenging climate, which wouldn’t necessarily, to my mind, be conducive to the emergence of a settled culture, that would be capable of undertaking a project on this scale.As somebody who’s built a lot of things and moved quite a few heavy weights in my time, I find the idea sort of perplexing to me, that they would be… What I would have to ask is what is their motif? What is their motif for undertaking a project on this scale? Because it’s an enormous project. To move a 20-tonne block of stone is really a challenging task to undertake."
[Joe Rogan]: Today.
"[INPUT]: Today. Well, without the infrastructure of large machines and so forth, but to do it by hand, it would be an enormous undertaking, and to me, it’s like when are they having time to hunt and gather when they’re engaged in a project of this scale."
"[INPUT]: But we know hunter gatherers have way more free time than modern society people do. That’s the one thing we’ve learned, is that it’s a pretty good way to make a living actually. They have a better, varied diet than we have. This is the Neanderthals diet, right? They have a better varied diet and a lot more free time."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but that’s —"
[INPUT]: And a lot less stress.
[INPUT]: We knew that all along about hunter gatherers when we were saying they couldn’t build megalithic sites.
[INPUT]: We’re looking at the time.
[INPUT]: They have the time to do it.
"[INPUT]: Where the environment is undergoing rapid changes to which adaptations would be extremely challenging. We know those changes are going on all over the planet. We know that sea levels are rapidly rising over a period of a few thousand years from a sea stand low of about 400 feet, up to the present level.We also know that biotas were shifting dramatically all over the planet. The effects of the Younger Dryas were global. Pretty much that is, I think, the emerging consensus now, that both hemispheres, north and south, were being affected by the climate changes of the Younger Dryas. What we’re doing is replacing this phenomenon, this project, within this context of these extremely challenging times, in which adaptation to the environmental changes could easily be the all-consuming challenge of the times.I’m just finding it difficult to see this disconnect between a project of this magnitude and the motif for doing it, during a time when obviously the environment could be posing serious constraints upon people’s ability to function, in that —"
"[INPUT]: Randall, we don’t even know the motives of the Eastern Islanders —"
"[INPUT]: No, we don’t."
[INPUT]: And why they raised these huge .. but we know they did it.
[INPUT]: But things like that become a central question. Something had to have motivated them.
"[Joe Rogan]: Let’s get Gobekli Tepe. Let’s just be real clear. We know they were humans. We know that it’s at least 12,000 years old, and we know that the real dispute here, the real question is did these people have structures and did they have agriculture. We know that they were human beings. They were essentially modern human beings. Were they hunter gatherers or did they have structures and agriculture."
"[INPUT]: Before Gobekli Tepe, they didn’t have structures and they didn’t have agriculture. After Gobekli Tepe, they did."
"[Joe Rogan]: The fact that they were able to build something so monumental, what kind of a leap is it at all to think that these people could figure out how to plant food and figure out how to make a house."
"[INPUT]: Again, if you look back 30,000 years, 40,000 years to these cave paintings, these are pretty sophisticated. Beautiful."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, they are."
"[INPUT]: Clearly, they had abstract reasoning. They could think from the concrete to the abstract and so on. It’s not a big reach to go from that to moving stones around."
[INPUT]: I’d say there’s a big difference between painting and engraving on cave walls.
[INPUT]: I don’t think so.
"[INPUT]: You’re creating the largest megalithic site that’s ever been built on earth. I think there’s a huge different between those two. Nobody would compare the construction effort on Stonehenge or Ġgantija with cave paintings. I agree with you, the cave paintings are magnificent. I’ve had the privilege to visit many of the painted caves. Stunning work. As Picasso said when he came out of Lascaux, “We have invented nothing.”That was that modern human mind, symbolic mind at work there, but this is another matter. This is a large scale construction project that’s going on, and it’s not just a construction project. It’s not like huts. It’s hundreds and hundreds of very large megalithic pillars, which have to be mobilized, brought to the place. Organizing a workforce in order to do that, even that requires preparation and time and learning and practice. It’s not something that you wake up one morning and just can do overnight."
[Joe Rogan]: You think that the paintings are more impressive than Gobekli Tepe?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, or at least comparable."
[Joe Rogan]: I think that’s absolutely ridiculous.
"[INPUT]: To convey three dimensionality on a 2D plane, that’s what Picasso meant. It’s like, “Wow! That’s incredible.” It’s like developing perspective, and to use the natural shape of a wall to create a three dimensional perspective look, that’s pretty abstract."
[INPUT]: You’re comparing apples and pears. It’s not a construction project.
[INPUT]: We don’t have to compare them.
[Joe Rogan]: But I don’t think it’s even remotely as impressive.
"[INPUT]: What I’m saying is that, it doesn’t take a huge leap of imagination to think… These people were pretty smart."
"[Joe Rogan]: We know that they were smart. We know that they were smart just because of the fact that those construction projects were done, by who? By whoever. We know that they were smart. Whoever built Gobekli Tepe was clearly intelligent. Whoever made those 3D carvings, clearly, they were intelligent. But to think that someone drawing on cave paintings is more impressive than erecting 20 foot stone columns with three dimensional carvings on them, of a lot of animals that weren’t even native to the region, is that debatable?"
[INPUT]: That’s not necessarily the case. The animals were native to the region.
"[INPUT]: My point Joe, is that these paintings are like say 30–40,000 years old to Gobekli Tepe, so there’s tens of thousands of years to develop more that we’re very likely to find more archaeological sites."
"[INPUT]: And yet, up till now, we haven’t found that. We haven’t found all of that intermediate material which… If I could actually see that intermediate material between the upper Paleolithic cave art and Gobekli Tepe, if I could see the gradual evolution and development of skills, I wouldn’t need to invoke a lost civilization that survivors of a lost civilization, who’ve mastered those skills elsewhere, to come in and teach those skills at Gobekli Tepe, but it still looks to me like a transfer of technology, unless you can show me that evolutionary process whereby I can understand how this group of hunter gatherers became equipped to create this giant site, where they practiced, where they learned the skills to move the stones, to organize the workforce, to feed and water the workforce in a rather dry place. All of that is actually quite a logistical challenge."
"[INPUT]: Yes, and obviously, somebody met it somehow."
[Joe Rogan]: Some humans.
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: So the real question is did they have structures? Did they have agriculture? Did they have some sort of a community where they lived in an established location?
[INPUT]: Probably something like that. I would imagine so.
[Joe Rogan]: That would push back the time where we thought that there was a civilization. That would push them back into a realm of at least stepping out of the hunter gatherer stage. Correct?
"[INPUT]: Your guy Schmidt, as you show in your book, he did not go as far as you go."
[INPUT]: Certainly not.
"[INPUT]: But he admitted it’s a mystery. That would be the scientific approach, “I don’t know what it is. Great mystery. Let’s just wait and see,” versus, “I’m going to postulate a lost civilization.” Nothing wrong with that, Graham. It’s a free country and scientists do this all the time, as you’ve mentioned."
"[INPUT]: There’s a rather humorous thing, which I have to say. Actually, I might even ask Jamie to pull up the couple of images of ‘Fingerprints of The Gods’. That’s the book I’ best known for. When I published ‘Fingerprints of The Gods’ in 1995, essentially, I was saying civilization is much older and much more mysterious than we thought. I was ridiculed for proposing that. 2013, one of the magazines that ridiculed me, New Scientist Magazine in Britain, publishes as a cover story, picture of Gobekli Tepe and the headline, ‘Civilization is Much Older and Much More Mysterious Than We Thought’."
"[INPUT]: Okay, fair enough. Scientists do do this. I’ve followed paleoanthropology for my whole adult life. One of the big mysteries is how did we get a big brain? How did we get to abstract reasoning, from what chimps can do? No one knows."
"[Joe Rogan]: The doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years, right?"
"[INPUT]: Because no one knows, every couple of years there’s a new book out. It’s climate change. It was —"
"[Joe Rogan]: The throwing arm, cooking food."
"[INPUT]: That’s right. Cooking meat. Meat is another big one. These books come and go. Some of them have legs, some of them don’t. It’s just the way it goes."
[Joe Rogan]: Then there’s Terence McKenna’s theory.
"[INPUT]: It’s pretty obvious, it was psychedelics."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. That’s Terence McKenna’s Stoned Ape Theory.
"[INPUT]: Not that it made the brain bigger, but that switched the brain on."
[INPUT]: Is this the old Julian —
"[INPUT]: Julian Jaynes’, no, the bicameral mind. Not at all. This is David Lewis-Williams, who’s professor of anthropology at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. His neuro-psychological theory of cave art, old [inaudible 00What a brilliant alternative thinker, but David Lewis-Williams at the University of Witwatersrand had been working on this problem since 1973 and his argument is that the remarkable similarities that we see in rock and cave art all around the world are explained that we’re dealing with a shamanistic art. Shamanism involves altered states of consciousness. This is typical visions of altered states of consciousness, and it seems to have accompanied a great leap forward in human behavior."
[Joe Rogan]: You covered this in your book.
[INPUT]: I covered it in Supernatural.
"[INPUT]: As did Richard Wranghman’s theory. This is a highly regarded scientist at Harvard. He’s the meat eating guy. That’s it’s cooking meat. That by cooking the protein, that’s what gives you the energy to build a huge brain. This guys is starting with ten pluses on his side. He’s Harvard and already respected. Even so, his book was like, maybe."
[Joe Rogan]: It’s probably a series of different events and a bunch of different factors.
"[INPUT]: It could be, that’s right. It could be a number of different things."
"[Joe Rogan]: Let’s get away from Gobekli Tepe and ancient civilizations and let’s get back to the geological evidence which Randall, you’re an expert at. This is one of the main things that you had a dispute with and this is one of the reasons why we got everybody together. Now, what is your thoughts on what Randall and Graham propose, specifically Randall, who is much more on the geological side of things?"
"[INPUT]: This is why I brought in my fauna friend, a geologist. By way of background, after your show, I thought, “Let’s just give this a fair hearing. This is what we do.” This will be our cover story in the end of summer issue comes out quarterly."
"[INPUT]: I hope that Mark Defunct is going to be doing so more work on the draft of his article for you that is up online, because that article is full of bullshit statements about me which are demonstratically false."
[INPUT]: He’s on.
[INPUT]: Yeah. He’s there and I’m happy to engage with those particular issues.
[Joe Rogan]: What statements Graham?
[INPUT]: I’ll have to put on my reading glasses.
"[INPUT]: Whatever article’s online, this has not been published yet."
[INPUT]: It claims that it’s a draft of the article that will appear in the 2017 edition of Skeptic Magazine.
[Joe Rogan]: Pull it up Graham and give you a chance to have your time… Let Graham go over it first and then we’ll have Mark on to refute what he said.
"[INPUT]: Here’s Defunct on ‘Magicians of the gods’. By the way, Michael, you say that you’re here to respectfully and to gather truth."
[Joe Rogan]: There it is. Conjuring up the lost civilization from nothing.
"[INPUT]: Let me just get to the top of this. I’ve got it here. Just near with me a second. Amongst the words in Mark Defunct’s article, he’s accusing me of duping the public. He’s saying that I’m public enemy number one. He’s accusing me of arm waving. I do wave my arms. Pontificating. Well, my grandfather was a minister of the church. Little interest in peer reviewed research. Claimed that no academic would debate. That’s utter bullshit.I had a debate with Zahi Hawass. He’s a leading Egyptian Egyptologist, back in 2015. That was not my fault that Zahi Hawass walked out on that debate. I can play the video if you like. A minute and a half of Zahi Hawass lambasting me and then walking out and refusing to debate further so it’s bullshit to say I don’t debate or I’m not willing to debate. Finally, he says that I’m conning a hellacious number of people into buying his books. How can we get any dialogue going when somebody begins like that?Then would you like some further? Bear with me because I just have to scroll down and I don’t have a mouse. I don’t have a mouse. Hancock and Carlson claimed several times that no academic would debate them. Not true. I’m accused of doing an about face since ‘Fingerprints of the gods’. Are my views not allowed to evolve with new evidence?"
[INPUT]: 49
"[INPUT]: 49Defunct doesn’t site that. He just presents me as buying what Jesus Gamarra says. If the standard that you’re going to have in Skeptic Magazine, you have a serious problem. Then Gobekli Tepe, he contends that Gobekli Tepe is too advanced to have been completed by hunter gatherers and must have been constructed by a more advanced civilization. No. That’s not what I say. I say it was constructed by hunter gatherers, but that they were advised and supported by people who had knowledge of this kind of work beforehand."
[INPUT]: How is that different?
"[INPUT]: I think it’s very different. I’m not saying it was constructed by, I’m saying that a group of people settled amongst hunter gatherers and transferred some skills for them. He quotes me, “Hancock makes the following stunning claim. “Our ancestors are being initiated into the secrets of metals and how to make swords and knives.”” I do not make that claim. I’m reporting that this claim is made in the book of Enoch. That is not my claim. Then what else?"
[INPUT]: You don’t think that’s the explanation.
"[INPUT]: I’m being misrepresented by your author here. If he wants to represent me, if he accuses me of cherry-picking, he shouldn’t cherry-pick my statements. He should quote it in full context."
[INPUT]: Let’s get it right. You don’t accept —
[INPUT]: It’s put there on the internet.
[Joe Rogan]: You’re still working on it but it’s published online?
[INPUT]: I didn’t know it was online.
"[INPUT]: Here’s a beautiful one. He cites Klaus Schmidt on the character. Schmidt makes a salient point, almost as if he anticipated Hancock’s book. “Fabulous or mythical creatures such as centors or the sphinx, wing-bulls or horses do not yet occur in the [inaudible 00Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. You’ve just been talking about the painted caves. Go to Chauvet cave. You will see a lion-man. Lion man carved out of mammoth ivory.Go to Chauvet, bison man, straddling lion woman. Her right arm is transforming into the head of a lion. Certainly these mythical creatures did exist in the upper paleolithic and it’s rubbish to say that they didn’t. Can I go on?The Tea Pot. Oh yeah. He’s taking issue with me because I suggest that the vulture on pillar 43 and enclosure D, is represent the tea pot asterism of the constellation of Sagittarius. He goes and gives us little things of Uncle Sam and some other thing that he shows. Anybody can impose any image on anything.It’s not my fault that a couple of academics who didn’t even talk to me and had nothing whatsoever to do to me, published a major study in the, I quote it again, The Mediterranean Archaeology and archaeometry, a peer review journal, where they make precisely that identification, so at least I’m not alone. At least there are peer reviewed credentialed scholars who also agree that that figure is representing the tea pot asterism within the constellation of Sagittarius. No reference to that."
[INPUT]: 52
"[INPUT]: Just to clarify what you do believe then, so that we don’t misrepresent you, you don’t think that the lost civilization instructed them on the use of metals?"
[INPUT]: I don’t know. I don’t see evidence for that at Gobekli Tepe.
[INPUT]: Why would you put that in the book then?
"[INPUT]: I didn’t put it in the book. I was quoting The Book of Enoch. It’s a huge passage on The Book of Enoch. It’s not me who’s saying that, it’s The Book of Enoch that’s saying that."
"[INPUT]: I understand, but why… I forget what the context —"
"[INPUT]: All I require your Defunct to do is to state that Hancock is citing The Book of Enoch. He didn’t do that. That’s, what’s the word? Disingenuous. Is that the polite word you guys use?"
[Joe Rogan]: It seems more than disingenuous. It’s a character assassination.
"[INPUT]: What the question is, is what’s the context of including that in your book? I forget."
"[INPUT]: The context is that actually, I was criticizing Zechariah Sitchin. That’s primarily what I was doing."
[INPUT]: So you don’t think that a lost civilization instructed the people who built Gobekli Tepe on the use of metals and tools?
[INPUT]: I see no evidence for that. I see Gobekli Tepe. I can’t go say they instructed them on the use of metals and tools unless I can find evidence for it.
[INPUT]: So what did they do?
[Joe Rogan]: We don’t know.
[INPUT]: They generated agriculture. They created a center of excellence around which hunter gatherer —
"[INPUT]: Not they who built Gobekli Tepe. The lost civilization that advised them, that you think happened. What did they do if they —"
"[INPUT]: They’ve come through a cataclysm. They’re survivors, few in number — this is my scenario. You don’t have to accept it. I’m sure you don’t. They take refuge amongst hunter gatherers. I don’t know. You probably have some survival skills. I don’t have many. If we would have a comet impact in the world today, which were to take out all the underpinnings of modern civilization, I might go settle with hunter gatherers because they’re the people who know best how to live and that’s situation."
[INPUT]: That’s where I would go. I have no survival skills.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, so go settle among hunter gatherers, but I might be able to transfer some of my knowledge to them. I might have something that I could transfer to them, and I might have very strong reasons why I might not choose to transfer all of it."
"[INPUT]: In other words, perhaps this is what happened. Okay, maybe, but how is that different from Zechariah Sitchin’s the aliens advised them?"
[Joe Rogan]: It’s a lot different.
"[INPUT]: I think it’s massively different, especially since Zechariah Sitchin has his aliens arriving in 1970s, NASA technology, weirdly. He wrote his book in the 1970s. I don’t go there. I don’t make that suggestion."
[INPUT]: Why not?
"[INPUT]: I’m simply saying, perhaps there’s been a forgotten episode in human history. Perhaps its fingerprints are present at a number of sites around the world, but perhaps the extremely defensive, arrogant and patronizing attitude of mainstream academia, is stopping us from considering that possibility, and therefore I campaign to get theta possibility considered and I try to do so with as loud a voice as possible."
"[INPUT]: Well, you’re doing it. You doing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Doesn’t it disturb you that you run Skeptic Magazine and someone publishes something like that. That goes against the whole idea of critical thinking. It’s misrepresenting his quotes, it’s misrepresenting his perspective, his point of view. It’s really disingenuous."
[INPUT]: This is one reason we’re doing this. So we can get his —
[Joe Rogan]: But why would anybody write something like that and why would you guys publish something like that without checking the facts?
[INPUT]: We are. This was not supposed to be posted online. This is the reason why —
[Joe Rogan]: It’s online though. Why does something get online if it’s not supposed to?
"[INPUT]: Why is such a person who would do that, a useful contributor to your side of the debate?"
"[INPUT]: One of the reasons we’re here is to get your point of your view exactly right, all right? Your saying that there’s no evidence that any lost civilization exists, only the fingerprints of their influence of later people we do know existed."
[INPUT]: I’m saying their physical objects. I say Gobekli Tepe is one of them. I say the sphinx is another.
"[INPUT]: But see, this is that argument from either ignorance or personal incredulity. I don’t accept the mainstream or I can’t think of how these pyramids could have been built therefore it was built by somebody else through some other technology."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s not what he’s saying. They’re just post-dating it.
"[INPUT]: That’s not what I’m saying. All I’m saying is the sphinx is older. I do go with Robert Shock’s argument on the geology. I’m also very interested in the astronomy of the site and again, I have slides that I could show on this if we have time. You might want to get into Ed Krupp’s criticism of the [rhine 00"
"[INPUT]: We do. I know Ed Krupp’s argument about that. That was from the 90s, I think."
[Joe Rogan]: What’s your thoughts on Robert Shock’s conclusions?
[INPUT]: That’s not something I know much about.
[Joe Rogan]: But it’s huge factor. It’s a huge factor because it’s all about water erosion.
"[INPUT]: Your Mark Defunct knows about Shock and he rejects him on the basis of that paper, and that paper really doesn’t date the sphinx. It works with dating of large blocks in the valley and the sphinx temples. There’s no single sample taken from the sphinx."
"[INPUT]: All right, then who dated it?"
[INPUT]: Who dated it? [Loristis and Fabiadu 00
[INPUT]: Then why do mainstream archaeologists not accept the older date for the sphinx? The answer is because they have whole bunch of other evidence that points to the date that they think it does.
"[INPUT]: The answer to your question is very simple. Mark Laner and Zahi Hawass put it on record back in 1992, when John Anthony West and Robert Shock first presented the rainfall erosion evidence on the sphinx.What Laner and Hawass said is, the sphinx can’t possibly be 12,000 plus years old, because there was no other culture anywhere in the world, that was capable of creating large scale monumental architecture like this. Show me one other structure that’s capable of doing that. They could say that in 1992 Michael, but they can’t say it in 2017, not since Gobekli Tepe’s been excavated."
"[Joe Rogan]: If you don’t mind Graham, could you please, for people, so this could be a standalone thing, people could understand, what is the argument about the sphinx, the enclosure of the sphinx and Robert Shock from Boston University, who’s a geologist, what was his conclusion?"
"[INPUT]: What Shock is saying is that the sphinx and the trench out of which the sphinx is cut, bears the unmistakable evidence of precipitation induced weathering. Weathering caused by exposure to a substantial period of heavy rainfall, and that is particularly pointed out in the vertical fishers in the trench.You see, the sphinx itself has been subject to so much restoration over so many years, that it’s difficult for people to even see the core body of the sphinx today. But its these, you can see the vertical fishers even down at the back of there. That is what Shock counts as rainfall precipitation-induced weathering.Heavy rainfall, which is selectively removing the softer layers and leaving the harder layers in place, and the problem is, we don’t have that rainfall in Giza, in Egypt, 4500 years ago. You have to go back much earlier to get that rainfall. That’s the suggestion."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s the suggestion by Robert Shock.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Independently of your conclusions or anything else?
"[INPUT]: Totally independently, yeah. Shock disagrees with me on many things, as a matter of fact, and I disagree with him on many things, but I think he’s on the money on this."
[Joe Rogan]: That alone would set back at least that one… It’s pretty much established that the great pyramid of Giza was constructed about 2500 B.C. right?
[INPUT]: There’s absolutely no doubt that a huge project went down at Giza around 2500 B.C. and it involved the pyramids.
"[Joe Rogan]: It is not that the whole thing was that much older, was that parts of it seemed to have been from an earlier civilization, or at least that civilization far earlier than was —"
"[INPUT]: I would say that the ground plan, what we have at Giza, the basic layout of the site, was established in what the ancient Egyptians called Zep Tepi, the first time. Astronomically and geologically, I and my colleagues suggest that the first time can be dated to the period of about 12.5–13,000 years ago.That that was when the site was laid out, because there’s intriguing astronomical alignments of the great pyramids, to the belt of Orion. I know Ed Krupp has a completely opposite view on this and of the great sphinx, to the constellation of Leo, rising due east, housing the sun on the equinox, the astrological age of Leo. Again, I have slides I can show."
[Joe Rogan]: That would align with the geological evidence that Robert Shock concludes with —
[INPUT]: It aligns with the geological evidence.
[Joe Rogan]: Thousands of years of rainfall.
"[INPUT]: The age of Leo pretty much exactly spans the Younger Dryas, as a matter of fact."
"[Joe Rogan]: So the only argument against that at the time, was that there were no other structures like that from 12,000 years ago."
[INPUT]: Correct. Then Krupp said that the Orion correlation wasn’t real because it was upside down. Do you want to get into that now?
"[INPUT]: First, that’s not the only argument, it’s that if the sphinx is built of the layout for the whole thing is built in 10–11,000 years ago, and then the pyramids are built 2500 B.C., what happened in between? Where are all the people, the trash, the places where they lived, in that area?"
[Joe Rogan]: There’s a bunch of different styles of construction.
[INPUT]: Something like a —
[INPUT]: But not dated in between.
"[INPUT]: I would propose, Michael, something like a monastery, which has a relatively small archaeological footprint, is on the side. The idea of information, knowledge and traditions lasting for thousands of years within a religious system, shouldn’t be too absurd to us. Judaism is dealing with ideas that are already best part of 4,000 years old if we go back to the Chaldis and so on and so forth. That’s all I’m suggesting really, that the idea is preserve, maintain, that the survivors —"
[INPUT]: Where?
"[INPUT]: On the site, but in something like a monastery, which has got a very small archaeological footprint. It is not high. Perhaps, again, one can only speculate, and I think there’s a lot of speculation on the archaeological side too. One can only speculate, perhaps having gone through a cataclysm, perhaps they felt to blame for this. Wrongly or rightly. There are many traditions in which humanity’s behavior is implicated in the cataclysm that takes place. Perhaps they didn’t want to switch civilization on completely right there.Perhaps they waited, passed down their knowledge through initiates. Enough was there to create a mystery because it’s undoubtedly a mystery that the construction of the great pyramids, the first huge pyramids in Egypt, preceded only really by the Djoser Pyramid at Saqqara, that the construction of the great pyramids is vastly superior to the construction of the pyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasty that follow it, and that’s a little bit counter-intuitive that we have this collapse in skills, one would have expected to get better, so it sounds like the work on the pyramids started already with a level of knowledge in hand."
[INPUT]: Yes. Here’s how I would think about that. There’s a lot of perhapsing and maybes because —
[Joe Rogan]: Always.
"[INPUT]: Yes. You have a bunch of Egyptologists and archaeologists who have been working on this site for centuries. This is one of the most ancient mysteries and so on. Let’s say there’s like 20 lines evidence that point to roughly around this time period here, then you come on and say, “Okay, but there’s this one anomaly of the rain thing. That there was only rain at this time. Now there’s a huge gap here of one anomaly or line of evidence here, and like 20 here."
[Joe Rogan]: We’re talking about different structures so there’s not a lot of evidence that points to this sphinx being from a particular time period.
"[INPUT]: He’s saying like 12,000, right?"
[INPUT]: I’m saying the rainfall evidence suggests that.
[Joe Rogan]: But other evidence.
"[INPUT]: And it’s alignment with the constellation of Leo housing the sun, at dawn on the spring equinox. This is an equinoctial mark and nobody would dispute that. Nobody would dispute that the ancient… No, if you make a monument pointing due east, I’ve stood on the back of the sphinx, at dawn, on the spring equinox, and believe me, again, I could show a picture, it’s headlines up perfectly with the rising sun. I don’t think anybody, even Krupp, is disputing that it’s an equinoctial mark. Now here’s the thing. You’re an ancient Egyptian. You’re building an equinoctial marker in 2500 B.C. Do you know what constellation is housing the sun in 2500 B.C.?"
[INPUT]: I haven’t run the little program to see.
[INPUT]: It’s the constellation of Torres.
[INPUT]: So?
"[INPUT]: So logically, if you’re creating an equinox, ancient Egyptians were no shy about making images of bulls. Plenty of them. If you’re making an equinoctial marker in 2500 B.C. you should create it in the form of a bull, not in the form of a lion. That’s the puzzling issue, and yet we do have a time when a lion constellation housed the sun at dawn on the spring equinox, and that is the period of the Younger Dryas."
[INPUT]: Okay. I’d say that’s a pretty big leap in that —
"[INPUT]: I know you’d say that, and your colleagues all say that too."
[INPUT]: Then we had a gap of about 5 or 6000 years where there’s nothing.
[INPUT]: Let me interject.
[Joe Rogan]: Please do.
"[INPUT]: I’m going to refer back to several articles that were published in the 80s and 90s. This one is from Nature, early 80s, ‘Late Quaternary History of the Nile’. What it’s discussing is the evidence that there was a major shift in the hydraulic regime of the Nile River. It says, between 20,000 and 12,000 years before present, when timberline in the head waters was lower, vegetation cover more open than today, the Nile was a highly seasonal braided river, which brought mixed course and fine sediments, down to Egypt and Sudan.This cold dry interval had ended by 12,500 years, before present, when overflow from Lake Victoria and higher rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary floods down the main Nile. Those files have been documented to have been 120 feet above the modern flood plain of the Nile.Any civilization or whatever you want to call it, living along the Nile River at that time, would have had to abandon whatever they were doing there, in this regime, this intensified hydraulic regime, and it says, it goes on to say, “It marked a revolutionary change to continuous flow, with a super-imposed flood peak. What happened is that there was a major environmental change that occurred right there, around 12,000 to 12,500 years. The dating could be adjusted somewhat since the early 80s, but the point is made, is that because of a major hydro-logical change, major vegetational cover change, major environmental change, this would have caused also imposed changes upon whatever culture was existing there or living there at the time.Now what we have is in the aftermath of that event, we have basically the emergence of desert, which now would require serious adaptation. It’s very likely too that these events could have also decimated the population at the time, leaving basically no workforce and then over a period of two or three or four thousand years, you find that there’s enough of a recovery that these kind of monumental structures can be renewed. But it’s clear from this and a lot of other studies, studies in the Eastern Mediterranean showing that there were sapropel layers, which is basically material that has been washed in, from the continental surface, that has not oxidized.It has essentially become rotten and carried in organic material, carried in off of the continents by this enhanced regime of water flow, actually forcing so much water that there was a fresh water lid on the Eastern Mediterranean, that caused a cessation in the circulation between the upper waters and the lower waters, reducing the amount of oxygen, brought down to the lower waters, and so you had these layers of mud that formed of the bottom of the Mediterranean, that showed this massive influx of fresh water flowing out of the Nile and off of the Egyptian continent, at the same time.Clearly, the evidence shows that there were major climatic changes that occurred around this time. It is not so speculative to imagine that whoever, whatever, and we don’t have to invoke any kind of a super advanced civilization, but whatever cultures were there that were perhaps capable of carving blocks of stone, transporting blocks of stone, if they were at Gobekli Tepe during this time range, would have been that their activity would have been interrupted to the extent that it might have taken millennia to recover, to get the labor force necessary to undertake major monumental programs on the Giza plateau.I think that if we assume this gradualistic scenario, yeah, that’s a fair question to ask. What happened in that interval. But if there is a major climatic downturn and a major disruption of the subtle patterns of whatever culture was already there, then now we might have an explanation why there would be a gap, especially of these events caused a bottleneck in the population of the area.Of course this is all speculative, but it is not speculative to say that there is multiple lines of evidence suggesting these major even cataclysmic changes that engulfed that part of the world, during that era. That could provide an explanation of why there is a gap there."
[Joe Rogan]: Makes a ton of sense.
"[INPUT]: Well, does it, because —"
[Joe Rogan]: Does it not?
"[INPUT]: Only if you have to have the sphinx in conjunction with 12,000 years ago and the lost civilization. If you just say the rainwater erosion on the sphinx is not an explanation for the age and that the traditional accepted age is what we think it is, then there’s no gap to fill. Really, all we’re talking about is we have, again, lots of evidence here, one anomaly here, I really want the anomaly thing to stick, so I’ve got to explain the gap. The gap is explained by environmental changes."
[INPUT]: But what is ‘the lots’ of evidence other than a lot of assumptions? It’s a lot of maybes.
"[INPUT]: They’re all assumptions. Actually, can you cite me a single contemporary inscription from the date that the sphinx is supposed to have been made, that refers to the sphinx?"
"[INPUT]: I’m sorry, say that again."
[INPUT]: Can you cite a single contemporary inscription from —
[INPUT]: Contemporary from?
[INPUT]: Contemporary to the date that Egyptologists ascribe to the sphinx. In other words to the Rann of Kubu. Can you cite me a single inscription that talks about the sphinx being built?
[INPUT]: I don’t study this area. I don’t know.
[INPUT]: You can’t because there is no such inscription.
"[INPUT]: Okay, so?"
[INPUT]: One would have thought there would be. It’s a giant project. It’s 270 feet long. It’s 70 feet high. It’s carved out of solid rock. Nothing. No reference to it at all in the old kingdom. You actually have to come down to the new kingdom to the references of the sphinx and inscriptions.
"[INPUT]: But you’ve already said that the pyramids were built at the time we think they were built, not thousands of years ago."
[INPUT]: I would say that a great deal of work was done on the pyramids on the time of 2500 B.C. I think the grand plan was laid out earlier.
"[INPUT]: We have the step pyramid, which is cruder or not as well designed as the other pyramids. That’s a transitional stage, at that time."
"[INPUT]: Often argued to be a transitional stage. You’ve been to the step pyramid, I’m sure."
[INPUT]: No.
[INPUT]: Brilliant. You’ve been to Giza though?
"[INPUT]: No, I’ve never been to Giza."
[INPUT]: Oh dear. They do make a very different impact. I’ve climbed the great pyramid five times. You’re dealing with something orders of magnitude different in terms of what’s required. This thing weighs six million tons.
"[INPUT]: Oh, I understand."
"[INPUT]: It’s 481 feet high. It consists of two and a half million individual blocks of stone. It’s aligned to true north within 360th of a single degree. To compare that to Djoser is really not a valid comparison at all. What’s more interesting to me is the radical decline that takes place in pyramid building skills, in the fifth and six dynasty.Go to Unas, go to Pepi, go to Teti at Saqqara. These are shambles. You can hardly even recognize them as pyramid. What happened to all that knowledge that’s invested in the great pyramid? Why does Egypt devolve so rapidly? How do we explain this pristine, amazing work that’s done on the great pyramid, unless there’s a legacy of knowledge being attached to it?"
"[INPUT]: Every archaeologist, Egyptian archaeologist, and Egyptian, knows everything you just said."
[INPUT]: They do.
[INPUT]: And they don’t accept any of your arguments. Why not?
"[INPUT]: That’s why I’m needed, because somebody’s got to counter this."
[INPUT]: Is it just that they’re close-minded and they follow Zahi Hawass and they never think for themselves?
[INPUT]: You want to see a closed mind? I’ll play you a one and half minute video of Zahi Hawass refusing to debate with me.
"[INPUT]: But all of them? Every one of the Egyptologists and the archaeologists over the last two centuries and so on, they’re all dogmatically close minded and they can’t see the arguments as clear as you, or is it they’re not convinced by your argument?"
"[INPUT]: They’re not convinced by my argument. They genuinely and absolutely believe that their argument is right. The notion that I’m proposing is apparently so preposterous to them, that it isn’t even worthy of consideration, but it is worth if insults and attacks on me, on my integrity., on my decency as a human being, on my honesty. All of those things get attacked because mainstream… And that’s fine. I’m ready for that.By the way, I know that archaeologists, academics, constantly attack each other all the time. I used to take this stuff personally but then when I see what they do to each other, the ravaging attack dogs are let loose on any new idea, I sometimes wish scientists would actually look for what’s good in a new idea rather than what’s bad, but I get why they do look for what’s bad."
"[INPUT]: In other words, some young graduate student working in that area could make a name for himself by overturning this —"
"[INPUT]: My son was a young graduate student at the University of Cardiff, studying Egyptology. He got marked down in his degree because he proposed the possibility that the pyramids and the sphinx might be or might have older origins. He was impressed by my work. It did him a lot of harm in his degree."
"[INPUT]: If all this was true, then eventually it would come out."
[INPUT]: You haven’t answered my point. You haven’t answered my point.
[INPUT]: Which is what?
"[INPUT]: If you go against the mainstream view, your career does not progress as an Egyptologist."
[INPUT]: I disagree.
[INPUT]: Give me an example.
[INPUT]: How is it that we know anything that we know about Egyptology now?
"[INPUT]: Give me an example from Egyptology, of somebody who’s gone against the mainstream view and been lorded for so doing."
[INPUT]: We don’t believe everything about it that we believed to centuries ago at say Napoleon’s time. Right? How did all that knowledge come about? How did all the change in that science develop?
[INPUT]: It really begins with Champollion and the deciphering of the Rosetta Stone.
[INPUT]: All right. How was he able to do that against the mainstream?
[INPUT]: There was no mainstream. The mainstream has taken time to form and it’s very solid now. Egyptologists all sing from the same hymnbook. You’ll find very little disagreement amongst them on anything.
"[INPUT]: But this is true on every field, but somehow or another, Einstein managed to make an impact because he turned out to be right."
"[INPUT]: I’m no Einstein and I don’t know if I’m right, but I’m going to continue to oppose that mainstream. Somebody has to."
"[Joe Rogan]: I don’t know if that’s a valid comparison, Einstein and archaeology."
[INPUT]: Take paleoanthropology. It’s a completely different field now than a century ago. How did that happen if no one ever accepts new ideas? They do. It happens all the time.
"[Joe Rogan]: They’re being forced to accept Gobekli Tepe, and that’s a new idea. Do you know what you were talking about things taking a long time and what seems like a time to us is really a blink of the eye in terms of archaeology, we’re in the middle of that. We’re essentially in the middle of that with things like Gobekli Tepe, with Forbes publishing an article about the Younger Drayas possibly being impacted by comets and that being one of the causes of mass extinction."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: These are all mainstream ideas now.
"[INPUT]: When Alvarez proposed the impact hypothesis for the demise of the dinosaurs in 1980, it was ridiculed, but he turned to be right and then that became the accepted mainstream."
[Joe Rogan]: It takes time.
"[INPUT]: Now, people are challenging that."
[INPUT]: But wasn’t the key turning point the finding of the crater? That’s what made the difference. It’s kind of hard to argue with that.
"[INPUT]: Where is your crater? This is where perhaps we need to bring in our phone-a-friend. Do you know Malcolm Lecomte, one of the Younger Dryas impact scientists. The point being made is the following. Firstly, that the primary impacts were on ice, that there may have been as many as four impacts, that they were on the North American ice cap. Some craters have been suggested, for example, the very deep holes in the great lakes."
"[INPUT]: 16One of the biggest strewn fields in the world, which is the Australian tektite strewn field, there’s no crater associated with that, but everybody accepts the impact proxies. There’s enough of them to justify that, and that’s what’s going on around this impact hypothesis now."
"[INPUT]: A related question to that is, not the lost civilizations and the demise of humans, but the mega faunal extinction of North American mammals. This has been long debated before the impact hypothesis was proposed, and the competing hypothesis were over-hunting, human just hunted them to the point, not every last one, to the point where the population numbers get too low and these species can’t survive, or climate change, or both.The climate change weakened the populations then the humans came over and over-hunted them. Then the impact hypothesis is proposed. This was debated and it didn’t fare that well because there were a lot of mammals and other species that didn’t go extinct, that you would expect from a massive impact like that. The kinds of species that humans would hunt, are the ones that went extinct, whereas these other didn’t."
"[INPUT]: Why must humans be hunting the largest… There’s no evidence that humans hunted the predators. There’s evidence that they hunted the mammoths, but it’s a very sparse… You have no more than a dozen sites that show association between human hunting and mammoths, and a lot of those like the Lubbock Lake site is being now being questioned, what was presumably, previously interpreted as being butchering marks on the mammoth remains, that are now being re-interpreted as possibly natural marks on the mammoth bones, but it’s a big stretch to go from, “Okay, we’ve got a dozen sites where we have mammoth remains and along with those mammoth remains, we have a few clover spear points.In two or three cases, we actually find or they have found spear point embedded within the mammoth, like in the rib cage, but it’s a very large stretch to go from there to say that 10 or 12 million mammoths or fore species of mammoths on four continents were wiped out by Paleo-Indian hunters probably in bands of no more than two or three dozen —"
[INPUT]: Have you ever been to a head smashed in buffalo site?
"[INPUT]: Yes, but that’s a good example because nowhere did that go anywhere close to exterminating the species of American bison."
"[INPUT]: But each site has its own particular explanation. Could be hunting, could be a massive flood, earthquake, whatever. They all have different —"
"[INPUT]: Could be a massive flood, yes. Exactly. I think there you and I would be in complete agreement."
"[INPUT]: This is what we mean by massive, there’s global versus local. For example, there’s 52 mammalian genero that went extinct in South America. Why would they go extinct in South America, about time that humans were moving down their hunting —"
"[INPUT]: The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, includes South America."
[INPUT]: It does.
[INPUT]: There were impacts there.
"[INPUT]: It does. Again, the dating of the migration of humans into South America, is controversial at this point. There is evidence that humans were there long before… Paul Martin’s idea of blitzkrieg requires that the animals be so stupid, that the had no adaptive capabilities to the appearance of a new predatory species, but what is being demonstrated from examining the life ways of the Paleo-Indian people, is that they had very diversified diets and they were hunter gatherers.Why would they be choosing the largest, most dangerous animals to hunt, when they had such a proliferation of other smaller animals. We know that they were forging. We know that they were eating sea food and fishing, because all of this is being found in the camps.It certainly doesn’t explain the extermination of the cave bears, the short-faced bears, the camelops, the giant beavers, the giant armadillos, the American plasticine lion, the ground slaws that were the size of giraffes, four species of probocedeans, meaning mammoths, extinct on four continents. To me like wait a second. We cannot invoke a modern example to say here is the —"
[INPUT]: How about the Maori?
[INPUT]: That’s controversial also.
[INPUT]: They drove the Mal birds extinct in —
[INPUT]: That’s an assumption. If you asked the Maori themselves —
"[Joe Rogan]: [crosstalk 00We don’t know why things survive and why don’t. It could be proximity to the impact. It could be that their food source wasn’t removed. It could be that their predators were wiped out and they managed to survive. There’s a lot of animals that are alive today in this continent.Like for instance, the pronghorn antelope. pronghorn antelope, Dan Floris is a wildlife historian, wrote an amazing book on it, what was he was talking about, the American Savanna during 15,000 plus years ago, there was all sorts of crazy animals millions of years ago that were like cheetahs, that were running down animals at extreme speeds, which is the reason why pronghorn antelopes can run so much faster than any of their current predators. Something much faster than them was killing them, and that was wiped out, but they managed to make it. One of the reasons why they probably managed to make it is because their predators were wiped out. Is not an even —"
"[INPUT]: Another point Michael, if it’s overkill, it’s intriguing that the overkill occurs precisely in the Younger Dryas window, because I think you’d agree that now the whole story of the peopling of the Americans is pretty much up for grabs. Clovers first was the dominant model for a very long time, and under that model, we’re to envisage these Clovers hunters coming in across the bearing land bridge, going down the ice free corridor, and then in like 800 years, with their sophisticated fluted points, they wipe out all the mammoths in North American, but now we know that humans have been coexisting and butchering mammoths, coexisting with mammoths for thousands of years before that, possible tens of thousands of years before that."
[INPUT]: You mean from evidence in Siberia?
"[INPUT]: I don’t only mean from evidence in Siberia. I can cite you from nature magazine just recently. Huge huge number. I don’t think the Uconn is in Siberia, is it?"
[Joe Rogan]: No.
"[INPUT]: I think the Uconn’s in North America. Jacques Cinq-Mars, the excavator of the Bluefish Caves in the Uconn, back in the the 1970s, was proposing that human beings had been in Americas at least 24,000 years ago. His reputation was utterly destroyed. His research funding was withdrawn, he was given no access to grants, he wasn’t able to do his work.He was heavily penalized and punished by the community and now, just a few weeks ago, we have the Smithsonian coming out and saying, “Sorry. We got it wrong. Jacques Cinq-Mars was right all along.”Tom Dillehay, with his work in Monte Verde, the shit that he had to take. I think we’re in very interesting time. The peopling of the Americas is really a paradigm that has absolutely been overthrown. The notion of clovers first —"
[INPUT]: I disagree.
"[INPUT]: Well, you disagree with Smithsonian then, which is fine. I do too."
"[INPUT]: The Mesa Verde, it’s an anomaly. It’s an isolated site. Where are all the sites between Clovers and Monte Verde, thousands of miles —"
[INPUT]: Do you honestly think Clovers was still first?
[INPUT]: For thousands and thousands of years and there’s no —
[INPUT]: Come on Michael. Do you think Clovers was still first?
[INPUT]: Hang on. Where are all the people between Clovers and Monte Verde?
[INPUT]: Not my problem.
[INPUT]: It is your problem because you’re the one —
"[INPUT]: No, not my problem. They’re there in Monte Verde and they’re there in North America. Go figure."
"[INPUT]: What’s more likely, that there’s a missing —"
[INPUT]: Go figure why there’s [inaudible 01
[INPUT]: It’s like the nature of the paper I brought up earlier.
[INPUT]: Maybe people crossed the ocean.
"[INPUT]: That the Neanderthals were humans in San Diego,130,000 years ago, but when you look at that, they have mammoth bones, it looks like they have might have been broken in the link, and the tools, but they’re not… Okay, the tools."
[Joe Rogan]: We’re kind of changing subjects here though.
[INPUT]: No.
[INPUT]: You’re trying to quibble the evidence of earlier human presence.
[INPUT]: That’s right.
[INPUT]: You’re trying to quibble it.
[INPUT]: I quibble just to challenge it.
"[INPUT]: You’re quibbling it, then you’ve got every right to say —"
[Joe Rogan]: What are you saying? What are you saying very specifically that’s opposing what he just said?
"[INPUT]: The reason archaeologists don’t accept earlier than Clover, earlier than 13,000–14,000 years —"
[INPUT]: But they do. They do. It’s massively accepted.
"[INPUT]: Say Mesa Verde for example, why don’t they accept Mesa Verde as a —"
[INPUT]: I have to bring up an image at this point. They do accept Mesa Verde. It is accepted now.
"[Joe Rogan]: Michael, are you sure about this?"
"[INPUT]: As what, 24,000 years?"
[INPUT]: 15 plus. possibly significantly older.
"[INPUT]: So 15 is kind of the outside of the window that humans came across the bearing straight, that’s possible. Not 24,000 years."
[INPUT]: Could you open Clovers first?
"[INPUT]: Not 130,000 years ago. If it turns our that that Nature paper is right and that’s confirmed, then that does overturn the mainstream theory for sure but —"
[Joe Rogan]: This is not like your field of study. Why would you argue against the Nature paper?
[INPUT]: I know. I ask professionals what they think.
"[INPUT]: Let’s quote the Smithsonian. Smithsonian, slide number five, today, decades later. The Clovers first model has collapsed. Based on dozens of new studies, we now know that pre-Clovers people slaughtered masterdons in Washington State, dined on desert parsley and oragon, made all purpose stone tools of where ice age version of the exact —"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, between 13,000. That’s not —"
"[INPUT]: All between that, and then 24,000 years at the bottom Michael. Are you saying the Smithsonian are wrong on this?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Michael, you’re jumping into conclusions before you even read that. You want to be right so bad that you didn’t read the part in other animals there."
[INPUT]: I don’t have a —
"[Joe Rogan]: No, hold on a second. Confirming that humans had butchered horsed and other animals there 24,000 years ago. It says it right there. You are against it without even reading it, which means you want to be right."
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: No? That’s absolutely what’s going on.
"[INPUT]: No, because I have no dog in this fight."
[Joe Rogan]: Why didn’t you read that whole thing before you started pointing at you being correct?
[INPUT]: I don’t care.
[INPUT]: You publish Skeptic Magazine and you have no dog in the fight.
"[INPUT]: You’re asking me, why don’t mainstream archaeologists accept dates in the tens of thousands —"
[INPUT]: You should be Skeptical of Clovers first.
"[INPUT]: Call it whatever you want. It goes back 11, 13, 15 —"
"[Joe Rogan]: What do you think about what that says, that there’s evidence they butchered horses 24,000 years ago?"
[INPUT]: I would have to check the site on that. I haven’t seen this article.
[Joe Rogan]: But now that you have seen it?
[INPUT]: Not my problem.
[INPUT]: Not my problem either because —
[INPUT]: But it is your problem because you’re the skeptic and you’re here opposing this and you’re saying there’s no evidence. You haven’t even read the fucking article.
"[INPUT]: I’m not opposing anything. I’m saying this is the reason why scientists accept these dates here because there’s lots and lots of evidence for 10,000, 11,000, 12,000."
[Joe Rogan]: They’re scientists.
"[INPUT]: Then you find one person that say 24,000, another one like two weeks ago that said —"
"[Joe Rogan]: This is not one person. This is very disappointing, that you’re arguing this without really doing any research about it."
"[INPUT]: The article is titled, what happens when an archaeologist challenges mainstream thinking. That’s in the Smithsonian in the month of March. Jacques Cinq-Mars, it was brutal experience, something that’s Cinq-Mars once likened to the Spanish inquisition. At conferences, audiences paid little heed to his presentation, giving short drift to the evidence, et cetera. It was always the same. When he proposed that Bluefish Caves was 24,000 years old, it was not accepted. What the Smithsonian are saying is now this is accepted. You need to get up to speed with the data Michael."
"[INPUT]: My archaeology friends like Jared Diamond who I just checked with on this, who’s at UCLA —"
[INPUT]: He certainly has a dog in the fight.
"[INPUT]: He just says, “Here’s the problem. For 50 years people propose pre-Clovers examples of sites or evidence. They never hold up. The dating turned out to be incorrect, he carbon 14 was not calibrated right, there was this, there was that. They never hold up."
"[Joe Rogan]: So essentially, you’re quoting a friend."
[INPUT]: You’re [crosstalk 001
"[Joe Rogan]: You’re quoting a friend who says the evidence hasn’t held up before, instead of quoting these articles with these scientists who are talking about the data that’s showing that human beings butchered horses 24,000 years ago. You’re disputing it just because you talked to a friend."
"[INPUT]: I’m saying that that has to be confirmed, that particular site that —"
[Joe Rogan]: But why argue against it?
[INPUT]: I’m not arguing against it.
[Joe Rogan]: You certainly were.
"[INPUT]: No, I’m just saying that this is —"
[Joe Rogan]: Is it me? Am I wrong?
"[INPUT]: I feel you were arguing against it and saying that it’s not the case and quibbling it and you seem to be… If I’m correct, you seem to be a Clovers first advocate. Put your reputation on the line and say you advocate Clovers first."
"[INPUT]: I’m not going to put a label on it. I’m going to say, in the latest evidence, that overwhelmingly shows humans coming across the Siberian straits into North America, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,000 years ago."
[Joe Rogan]: That they definitely did then. They definitely did then. Did they before?
"[INPUT]: What could push it back much earlier would be if they came by boat. Like Island in Santa Barbara. There are sites on the Channel Islands that go back 11, 12,000 years ago, and they came by boat. Now, the problem is if they lived on the shores, which is where the good fishing and eating is those are under water and short of doing good under water archaeology, which is hard to do and expensive, and most of it’s probably gone. We may never know."
"[INPUT]: One of my beefs with archaeology actually is that 10 million square miles of the planet that were above water during the ice age are under water now, and marine archaeology is still mainly looking at ship wrecks."
[INPUT]: They do that because it’s where the light is.
"[INPUT]: It leaves a big unanswered question. Anyway, for the record, can I at least say that you completely opposed the Smithsonian’s position on this, that there has been no paradigm shift."
"[INPUT]: I will look at this. I haven’t seen this piece or anything. I’m not aware of the horse find from 24,000 years ago. I am aware of the 130,000 year date from the Nature paper two weeks ago."
[INPUT]: I have a slide on that too.
[Joe Rogan]: I think the major speculation —
[INPUT]: Show the stone tools. They’re nothing like Clover’s points. It’s just a big hand rock that might have been used. It might have been random.
"[INPUT]: Sorry. A big hand rock is all their is before 13,000 years ago?"
"[INPUT]: No. I’m talking about the 130,000 year old site."
"[INPUT]: Oh, 130,000 year old site."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, you’re talking about the San Diego thing. Yeah."
"[INPUT]: We don’t need to talk about that. That raises interesting questions. Was is Neanderthals? Was it Denisovans? Was it anatomically modern humans 130,000 years ago. It raises interesting questions but —"
"[INPUT]: Or is it a mis-dated site? Or is it a mis-interpreted site because there aren’t stone tools, they’re just rocks."
[INPUT]: I’m not pinning anything to that. I’m saying yes [crosstalk 01
"[Joe Rogan]: The full question is not necessarily just about the stone tools, it’s about how the bones were shattered, and they believe the bones were shattered deliberately, indicating that someone was trying to get out the marrow, indicating —"
"[INPUT]: Maybe, or —"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, maybe."
[INPUT]: A tractor rolled over it a couple of years ago and it was excavated and broken then. That’s one of the —
[Joe Rogan]: No. No one had excavated. That’s just speculation on your part.
"[INPUT]: No, nor my part. This was one of the responses to the paper."
"[INPUT]: Immediately, the fight has been quibbled by the archaeological mainstream. Of course, it’s been published by the archaeological mainstream too and the rest of the mainstream is quibbling it. We will see how that plays out."
[INPUT]: I thought you said that can’t happen?
[INPUT]: What cannot happen?
[INPUT]: That the mainstream won’t allow radical ideas to challenge the —
[INPUT]: Nature published it and the idea is being quibbled.
[INPUT]: Here the Smithsonian published so apparently it’s okay.
"[INPUT]: Nature certainly would not have published it if the evidence were not strong. I accept that. Nature’s not in the business of publishing fringey stuff. It is a radical proposal, but it’s strong enough to justify a publication. Nature, what’s interesting to me is that the immediate reaction of the archaeological community is now, “What could this mean? Let’s look into the implications of this.”If there were Neanderthals or Denisovins, in North America, 130,000 years ago, we have a whole new scenario building here that really should interest everyone. Instead the first reaction is, “Let’s destroy this because it’s really annoying. Let’s get rid of it. Let’s prove it’s wrong. Let’s suggest that it was a fucking bulldozer or something like that. Maybe it was. I don’t know.The work hasn’t been done yet, but that instant sort of… It’s almost like an immune response to an idea that doesn’t fit into the prevailing paradigm, the other work, the work in South America, the Bluefish Caves work, that’s really not controversial anymore. That’s very widely accepted. Clover’s first is a discredited and abandoned position.I have something else to ask you actually, concerning genetics and DNA. I’m sure you’re well up on that. Can you explain why we have a strong signal of Denisovin DNA in certain groups of South American Indians, and in Australian Aborigines and Melanisians? But that Denisovin DNA doesn’t crop up in North American Indians. How would we explain that if they all came through the bearing straight?"
[INPUT]: I have no idea.
[INPUT]: Could be boats.
[INPUT]: This just happens to be something I don’t know anything about. Part of the problem of even doing this —
[INPUT]: It was your idea.
"[INPUT]: Well, here we are talking. This is good. But part of the risk is that you’re going find something I don’t happen to know about., and then it’s like, “You see, I made my point.” What point? Like the history of the peopling of America, that area, there’s always somebody that comes in with, “It’s not Clovers. It’s this, it’s that,” and rarely do they last. Why? The dates were mis-calibrated or whatever. It’s not just that scientists are closed-minded, although they can be. It’s that the convergence of evidence isn’t strong enough to overturn the mainstream theory, but it does happen.Maybe there were multiple migrations into North America and we just don’t have all the sites, but when somebody comes up with a site that’s tens of thousands of years earlier than all the others that are accepted here, and it’s over here, where are all the sites in between? It’s like the 5,000 year gap with the Egyptian complex. Where are sites, if it’s true. They didn’t fly there, so how did they get there? There must be a trail somewhere that we could find, unless they came by boat, and then that evidence is gone."
"[Joe Rogan]: Or, unless you’re dealing with 24,000 years ago and there’s not much evidence to find."
[INPUT]: Maybe.
"[INPUT]: But if they came by boat, then that clearly implies they had navigational skills, they had the ability to build boats and find their way across the ocean and —"
[INPUT]: You can do with the coast. You don’t need a big ocean going.
"[INPUT]: You don’t need an ocean going, but there’s also —"
"[INPUT]: This is one hypothesis that’s proposed, is that they came across by boat just following the shore."
[Joe Rogan]: The same area is the bearing straight.
[INPUT]: Yeah. You’re just 100 feet off shore. You can go in and…
"[Joe Rogan]: Most likely both, right? One of the issues of course was the short-faced bear was so formidable, according to Dan Floris, that it would have been a huge impediment for people crossing on foot anyway. The short-faced bear went extinct right around the time where you see more evidence of human beings entering in, but why did he go extinct? That’s the big question."
[INPUT]: You have to ass that to the list of predators that there would have been no reason for humans to have been hunting.
[Joe Rogan]: That’s an enormous animal.
"[INPUT]: There are two factors that go in here. There’s positive evidence in favor of a hypothesis, then there’s negative evidence against the mainstream hypothesis. You really need both. It’s not enough to just say, “I don’t accept the evidence for here that, “Okay, that’s fine.” Scientists do that all the time."
"[Joe Rogan]: What evidence? Let’s speak in specifics because you keep doing this. You keep saying, “Well, they find things and it turns out, no, that’s not true.” You’re essentially proving your point of being a skeptic without having any real cases. You just keep saying this."
[INPUT]: All of the cases we’re talking about.
"[Joe Rogan]: You can’t say all the cases. If you don’t want to cite anything specifically, don’t keep bringing up things that are refuted because you don’t have anything that you’re pointing to, so you’re just muddying the water. You’re essentially pissing in the pool."
"[INPUT]: The Clovers thing for example. Gobekli Tepe, the pyramids. All of these —"
[Joe Rogan]: What’s been disproved?
"[INPUT]: I’m making a slightly different point, that —"
[Joe Rogan]: That’s the problem. You’re not addressing the actual issues we’re talking about. You muddy the water by saying things have been tossed out the window so we have to be careful here and toss these things out the window as well.
"[INPUT]: Not toss out, just contemplate them, published in Nature for example, so let’s watch what happens to the 130,000 year old hypothesis. If it holds up and there’s other sites that are dated that way and so on and so forth, that will be truly revolutionary and scientists would accept it."
"[INPUT]: You see, the problem is that when you have a very strong paradigm like Clovers first, which really dominates American archaeology , pre-historic archaeology for a very long period, it’s difficult, from a career point of view, for archaeologists to come up and propose alternative sites. Those who did like Tom Dillahey, like Jacques Cinq-Mars, paid a very heavy price for so doing."
[INPUT]: 37
"[INPUT]: Certainly, we don’t like to think that scientists do that. They do that. Are you familiar with Michael Cremo’s book, Forbidden Archaeology?"
[INPUT]: Yeah. I know Michael.
"[INPUT]: He makes, in my mind, as compelling a case as you do, and for his, humans were here, tens of millions of years ago. His book is 900 pages long."
[Joe Rogan]: Tens of millions?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, tens of millions. He’s a Hindu. His idea is this sort of long recycling and —"
[Joe Rogan]: What evidence is it based on for tens of millions of years?
[INPUT]: I’m not here to defend Michael Cremo or to have a discussion about Michael Cremo. That’s not why I’m sitting at this table.
"[INPUT]: I understand, but my point is that —"
[INPUT]: Michael Cremo is not me.
"[INPUT]: That’s right, but there’s lots of alternative archaeology, is where I began. There’s lots of alternative archaeology books and theories of [crosstalk 01"
[Joe Rogan]: But what evidence is there that supports that?
[INPUT]: None.
[Joe Rogan]: But why are you bringing up that when there’s evidence that he’s bringing up.
[INPUT]: Cremo’s evidence is similar to his.
[Joe Rogan]: Why?
"[INPUT]: It’s mostly negative evidence, that I don’t accept the date of this. There is this peculiar footprint looking thing in the mud."
"[INPUT]: Cremo refers specifically to the knowledge filter. The most useful about that book is the publication of reports, archaeological reports, which are no longer available to the public, which do suggest an alternative point of view. I would say it’s a very useful book to read. Beyond that, I have nothing to say about that."
"[Joe Rogan]: But that’s not necessarily true. You’re saying his only evidence is — He’s pointing to some pretty significant evidence. Like the sphinx thing is a geologist from Boston University, proposed this, because of water erosion. Because of water erosion that could have only been done by thousands of years of rainfall in his opinion, as a qualified geologist. That’s not a lack of evidence."
[INPUT]: I understand but why do no other geologists or archaeologist —
[Joe Rogan]: That’s not true.
"[INPUT]: Actually, they do. I’ve had multiple conversations with Robert where he has cited the fact that he has gotten a considerable body of support from other geologists, not from Egyptologists, but geologists who do recognize the effects of sever water erosion on limestone, carbonate rocks, and that’s what we have there. We have severe water erosion. It appears and is preserved on the quarry walls around the sphinx.The sphinx itself as Graham said, is difficult to ascertain because of all of the reconstruction that has gone on, but the quarry walls, which would have once had the very distinct stepped profile of a typical profile, no longer have that. Now they have a textbook profile, a parabolic profile, that would be consistent with sheet flooding, which would be both disillusioned because carbonated rocks dissolve in acidic waters and what’s called corresion, which would be the effects of water loaded with sand sediment, which would make it very rough.If you’ve got the sand sediment flowing over the edge of what would have been a quarry wall, what you’re going to end up with a smoothing off of the rough corners and the final result would be a very rounded profile like you see there, and you would also see where the fishers in the rock would be selectively widened and opened by the water penetrating those fishers. It has all of the ear marks of a very textbook case of water erosion."
[Joe Rogan]: Don’t you think it’s very disingenuous comparing that to someone who things that human beings have been here for tens of millions of years with no evidence to support it whatsoever?
[INPUT]: He doesn’t say he has no evidence. He has a 900 page book full of evidence. It’s the quality of the evidence when you say —
[Joe Rogan]: What about the quality of that evidence?
"[INPUT]: If it was that good, we’re not geologists sitting here. If it was that good, why don’t geologists look at it, go, “He’s right.”"
[Joe Rogan]: But they do.
[INPUT]: They do. That’s the point.
[Joe Rogan]: You’re not listening.
[INPUT]: They do? They all do?
"[INPUT]: No, they don’t all do."
[Joe Rogan]: Some do. That’s why it’s in dispute.
[INPUT]: Some geologists who work with Egyptologists say that Shock is wrong.
[INPUT]: We have a geologist on the line. Why don’t we ask him? Mark.
[Joe Rogan]: We can have one guy’s opinion. We could also have other guys’ opinions that we can get from other source.
"[INPUT]: This matter has been in the public domain since 1992. It hasn’t gone away. Shock’s argument that we are looking at precipitation induced weathering on the sphinx has not been debunked. It has been opposed. It has been disagreed with, but that is different from saying it’s debunked and Shock stays solid and strong on that issue. He is a credentialed geologist. He is a professor of geology at the University of Boston. He has a right to speak out about this."
[INPUT]: Of course.
"[INPUT]: He stated his view. I happen to find his view very interesting, especially since it correlates with what I regard as the interesting astronomy of the site. I think that site has origins that do go back into the Younger Dryas. That’s my opinion. I’ve stated it many times and I’ve presented the evidence that I think underwrites that opinion. You and your colleagues are absolutely at liberty to disagree, and you do."
[Joe Rogan]: You don’t think it’s disingenuous to compare that to someone who says something that defies our current understand of human beings and the actual evolution of humans? You’re talking about someone who’s saying that human beings are how many millions of years old?
[INPUT]: Tens of millions.
"[Joe Rogan]: We know for a fact, right? If you’ve paid attention to evolution?"
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: We weren’t even humans a million years ago, correct?"
"[INPUT]: Joe, there are creations who think —"
[Joe Rogan]: We’re not talking about that. We’re talking about Graham Hancock.
"[INPUT]: I know. But my point was that, here you have the mainstream scientists and there’s Graham. He seems so reasonable, but there’s 50 like him and each of them thinks that they’re right."
"[INPUT]: That’s your language. He seems so reasonable. Right there, you’re accusing me of dissimulation."
[Joe Rogan]: You’re saying there’s 50 like him.
"[INPUT]: The subtext is that I’m not, and then there’s 50 like me. What patronizing, arrogant, deeply unpleasant and personal approach."
"[INPUT]: Graham, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it to sound like that. I really don’t."
[INPUT]: Okay.
[INPUT]: I have a larger point.
[INPUT]: Apology accepted.
"[INPUT]: When you’re faced a bunch of different alternative theories that are coming in, take physics, every physicist, like you just had Lawrence Krauss, he gets these letters daily, of people saying, “I think I figured why Einstein was wrong.” He can’t address them all. They are smart people, they are thoughtful people, they really believe it. What do you do with that? That’s my point."
"[INPUT]: I feel that’s not my problem. If there are other alternative theories, that’s not my problem either. It’s the problem for the mainstream to sort it out and figure which to pay attention to and which not."
"[INPUT]: Well, all right."
"[INPUT]: I’m suspicious of this, the whole idea of the mainstream, because even looking in the mainstream, you find so many divergent points of view, that I think that’s basically a fiction, that there is this mainstream that has arrived at this consensus, and that there are no alternative ulterior motives there and that there are no dogmas that are being perpetuated there.I look at a lot of the geological stuff and realize that there many different points of view. When we talk about these floods at the end of the last ice age, there are many divergent points of view. There is what could be considered the mainstream, yet even that has multiple interpretations. The same with the comet idea. I don’t know what constitutes the mainstream there because there have been a group that has opposed it at every turn. But at the same time, the group that accepts the comet hypothesis has continued to grow.In fact, there’s even a number of individuals involved that set out specifically to disprove it or discredit it, who are now basically on board. It has grown from being a small handful of scientists, to they’re now 63 scientists, from 55 different institutions, that are on board with the idea that something remarkable happened at the end of the last ice age.It was probably exogenic, meaning something from outside, something from space. There’s no consensus as to exactly what that was, which would be normal because these discoveries are in their infancy at this point. But there’s been an attempt to discredit the idea, simply because that as the evidence has come in over the last decade, it has evolved and new mysteries have been opened up as the evidence comes in, and the claim is being made, “There’s no consistent interpretation of this evidence, and therefore we debunked it.”"
"[INPUT]: An example is [inaudible 01I see a very one-sided game being played here with a group of academics, who are determined to demonstrate that there could have been no possibility of anything like a comet impact 12,800 years ago, and that these 63 or 65 scientists who are proposing that are just completely wrong, and when they refute the refutations, I very rarely see that referred to or commented at all.Your colleague, Defunct, has dismissed the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, without actually going in detail into the debate that’s gone on."
[INPUT]: He has this graph in his paper showing all these different dates for these different —
"[INPUT]: That’s from one of the critical papers. There’s another side to this argument. He needs to be listening to what the other side will say. That’s the point where maybe we should have Mark Defunct come on and maybe we should have Malcolm Lecomte come on as well, because Malcolm Lecomte is actually one of those 63 Younger Dryas impact scientists."
[INPUT]: Yeah. Let’s do it.
"[Joe Rogan]: Explain to people that are just listening to this, what is this graph that you’re showing?"
"[INPUT]: This is the carbon 14 date ranges from samples taken from the Younger Dryas’ boundaries. This is the boundary here and the point of this is that there’s not a single consistent series of dates that would consistently show, “Yeah, absolutely for sure at every site it comes in right there,” is that the bounce around a lot here. Maybe Mark, this is his area, he could come on and Skype here and tell us —"
[Joe Rogan]: They bounce around and what’s the point of this for the lay person who’s listening to this?
"[INPUT]: If you take the ones that are above the grey line, then those are showing that something like an impact happened much later, and the ones below it are that it’s much earlier, so where’s the consistency of a single impact consistent across that middle of that grey line."
"[Joe Rogan]: I don’t think there’s any argument there was a single impact. In fact, there’s arguments —"
[INPUT]: [crosstalk 01
"[Joe Rogan]: No, there’s more than one date. We’re talking about a stretch of thousands of years and multiple impacts. Randall?"
[INPUT]: The Younger Dryas runs 1200 years.
"[Joe Rogan]: Randall, please give me your… You’re the expert of this."
"[INPUT]: These are dates for the Younger Dryas. There’s big spread obviously, but there’s also a lot of possibilities for introducing inaccuracies into the dating. What’s called the old wood effect can sometimes make it appear to be older than it is by a millennium or to millennium, but what we certainly do see here is a clustering right around 13,000 years ago, that looks pretty evident to me, and everybody knows, who does radio carbon dating, that the dating might have errors and inconsistency in it.The one article I think that came out last year by James Kennett and 25 others, was the Bayesian chronological analysis, consistent with synchronous age of 12,835 to 12,735 calibrated years before present, for Younger Dryas boundary on four continents."
[INPUT]: That’s the refutation of precisely what you’re publishing.
[INPUT]: It is. It’s a refutation of this.
[INPUT]: But Mark Defunct does not refer to that refutation.
"[INPUT]: Jamie, could you pull up the age of Leo? I think I gave that to you, and go to slide number 167. 167. Go to slide 167."
[Joe Rogan]: Jesus! You’re not fucking around. 167 slides?
"[INPUT]: There we go. There we go. A cosmic impact at 12,800 calibrated years before present formed the Younger Dryas boundary layer containing peak abundances in multiple high temperature impact-related proxies including spherals, meltglass and nanodiamonds. Bayesian statistical analysis of 354 dates from 23 sedimentary sequences over four continents established a model Younger Dryas boundary age of 12,835 calibrated years before present, supporting a synchrony idea of the Younger Dryas boundary layer of high probability, 95%.This range overlaps that of a platinum peak recorded in the Greenland Ice Sheet end of the onset of the Younger Dryas climate episode in six key records, suggesting a causal connection between the impact event and the Younger Dryas. Due to its rarity and distinctive characteristics, the Younger Dryas boundary layers proposed as a widespread correlation data."
"[Joe Rogan]: Randall, if I can remember what you said correctly, you believe that there was probably more than one significant impact over a period of several thousand years."
[INPUT]: Let me pop in on that very quickly. I don’t mean to cut you off.
[INPUT]: Go ahead.
"[INPUT]: Let’s be clear. The suggestion is that 12,800 years ago, there was… Comets break up into multiple parts. Anybody who saw the Schumacher levy nine NASA films back in 1994 is aware that that Comet broke up into more than 20 fragments, all of which hit Jupiter sometimes creating explosions larger than the earth itself. All right? I don’t think it’s controversial that comets break up into fragments.This is the suggestion of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, that we’re dealing with a giant comet that broke up into multiple fragments that orbits in the torrid meteor stream and that four of those fragments, that’s the suggestion, four largest fragments fell out of the torrid meteor stream, coming in on a trajectory roughly north west to south east, crossing the North American ice cap and there are up to four impacts on the North American ice cap.The impact is then continued across the Atlantic Ocean. There a suggestion of impact in Belgium and indeed as far east as Abu Hureyra in Syria. It’s a global event. 50 million square kilometers of the earth’s surface is within the Younger Dryas boundary field, so it’s a really huge thing. The suggestion is that there were multiple impacts at the beginning. The next question is what happened 11,600 years ago when the Younger Dryas ends. Global temperatures shoot up incredible rapidly and the science on that is much less advances than the science on the beginning of the Younger Dryas.Fred Hoyle, back in the 1980s, was puzzled by the sudden temperature increase at the end of the Younger Dryas, and he suggested presciently, I would say, that this may have been cause by a comet impact in an ocean, so maybe other bits of the torrid meteor stream impacted the earth. Other filaments within the stream impacted the earth 11,600 years ago, or maybe something else caused it.Robert Shock is in favor of extraordinary solar activity being responsible for that warming. We don’t absolutely know, but that’s broadly the suggestion, where at the beginning and the end. It certainly impacts at the beginning, possibly impacts other things at the end."
"[INPUT]: Clube and Napier and others, Duncan Steele and other astronomers have speculated that there could be impact errors, e-pax, in which there’s an enhanced possibility of the earth being impacted, particularly if you have a large comet that enters into the solar system begins to undergo a hierarchy of disintegrations and basically litters the inner solar system with material.We do know that the earth crosses the torrid meteor stream twice each year, once in late June and once in late October, early November. We know that the Tunguska event if 1908, which is not speculative, I mean, that happened, it occurred on June 30th, which would have been the peak of the torrid meteor shower. It also came from the direction of the sun.Its position in space where it’s emanated, its radium point in space from which it emanated at that time, was totally consistent with the torrid meteor stream radiant. It’s very possible that the Tunguska event of 1908 was a me member of that family of meteorites. Again, there’s nothing definitive there, but it would be a prime candidate for investigation, that perhaps… Again, I mentioned earlier, this goes back to the work to the work of Fred Whipple, way back in the 1940s, who began to research the torrid meteor stream and came to believe that it was much more active in the past than it is now. That it’s an old diffuse meteor stream that at one time, and like Graham said, it has multiple objects still within it."
[INPUT]: Comet encke is the best known.
[INPUT]: Comet encke.
[INPUT]: That’s a fragment of the original giant comet.Randall; Of the original giant comet that they estimate might have been based upon the amount of material still remnant in the zodiacal light cloud that perhaps it was somewhere around 60 miles or 100 kilometers in diameter.
"[INPUT]: Another thing that I’m taken to task for is that I report the work of Clube and Napier and their suggestion that the torrid meteor stream is actually fucking dangerous, and that we should be paying attention to it. That it has been a hidden hand in human history in the past, and that it can cause us trouble in the future. This is not gloom and doom. We have the technology to deal with the large objects in the torrid meteor stream if any filaments are on an orbit that will result in impacts on the earth.At the very least, it’s extremely unwise of us not to pay attention. I’m accused of being a doom-monger and constantly predicting the end of the world and this and that, but actually, I’m simply reporting astronomers who are very concerned about the torrid meteor stream and the possibility that we may face further impacts from it in the future. That’s not woowoo. That is science."
"[INPUT]: Absolutely, and I would agree with that. That is a form of catastrophism that scientists accept as very real."
[INPUT]: Some do.
"[INPUT]: Well, lots."
"[Joe Rogan]: What, if anything, do you oppose about what they’ve just said?"
[INPUT]: Nothing.
[Joe Rogan]: Nothing? Nothing about the Younger Dryas period —
"[INPUT]: Just a technical question, your slide was 12,800 on there so Gobekli Tepe, the older see dates are 11,600. All right. That’s a 1200 year gap. That’s a kind of a slow catastrophe."
"[INPUT]: No. Gobekli Tepe, to be very clear about the Younger Dryas, one of the puzzling things about it is that you have cataclysm at the beginning and this global temperature slump is surely cataclysmic by any standards, and you have cataclysm at the end. You have massive spike, huge increase in global temperatures and you have meltwater pulse 1B. You have a lot of water going into the ocean at that time, so both ends of the Younger Dryas are cataclysmic.It’s at the recent end of the Younger Dryas, 11,600 years ago, that we see Gobekli Tepe mysteriously popping up. I know that you’re a staunch opponent of Atlantis and that you believe Pleto made Atlantis up in order to make a political point, and you may be right, but the date that Pleto puts on the submergence of Atlantis is 11,600 years ago, 9,000 years before the time of Solon, which happens to coincide with Meltwater Pluse 1B, and the end of the Younger Dryas, which I would have thought would cause you to rethink your position on Pleto just a little."
"[INPUT]: Well, it’s interesting. I’m open to the idea. I tend to read myths in the same way your guest, Darren Peterson does, that it’s a story to deliver some sort of moral homily to us. It’s a commentary on our own culture, our society. It’s a way, a literary way of delivering a message to people. That’s how I tend to read, instead of reading them like, “Let’s see if we can figure out what happened historically.”"
"[INPUT]: But there’s hard data in Pleto’s whatever you think it is, and that hard data is that the submergence of Atlantis happened 9,000 years before the time of Solon. That is a date. That is 9600 B.C. That is 11,600 years ago. This, to me, is a strong reason why we shouldn’t just completely dismiss Pleto’s notion of a lost civilization of the ice age."
[INPUT]: I’m not against that idea. The idea that the parting of the Red Sea happened because of some impact —
[INPUT]: I’m not proposing that. Please don’t go there.
[INPUT]: I know. I’m just saying.
[INPUT]: Waste of time.
[INPUT]: But there are people that think that.
[INPUT]: I don’t.
[INPUT]: Or that the plagues of the Bible can be explained by natural events.
[INPUT]: I don’t go there. Waste of time. Deal with Pleto.
"[INPUT]: My point is that some of them may have historical origins, some of them may be completely made up as mythic stories for some other reason. You have to take them one at a time. In my opinion, the Pleto one is a commentary on his own culture of Athens and being to bellicose, being too warlike, and that this is not good for where we’re going. That’s my opinion."
"[INPUT]: The fact that he picks a date that coincides with a geologically significant date of flooding, is not really going to change your opinion."
[Joe Rogan]: It’s a pretty amazing coincidence.
"[INPUT]: Is it? We’re finding the connection, not Pleto."
"[INPUT]: Pleto said there was an advanced civilization with advanced agriculture, advanced architecture, advanced navigation abilities, which was submerged by the sea, swept from the face of the earth, so that mankind had to begin again, like children, with no memory of what went before, and lo and behold, he puts a geologically significant date on that. A date that we ourselves have only known as significant in the last 20 or 30 years."
"[INPUT]: Where is this place, this Atlantis? As you know, there’s a —"
[INPUT]: Not my problem.
"[INPUT]: There’s a long history of people speculating. If we found a site, that would be a big plus."
[INPUT]: That is in archaeology.
"[INPUT]: If we take it literally, obviously then it’s below the ocean. I don’t necessarily take Pleto’s account literally, but I do say, it’s rather coincidental that his dating falls exactly on Meltwater Pulse 1B, when we know there was huge influx of water into the ocean. Also, if we look at his geography, it’s interesting because he cites basically a land mast, west of the Pillars of Hercules, which is Pillars of Hercules, the straits of Gibralta, and he places this essentially in the mid-Atlantic.I think it was Crant, of one of the commentators on him that said it was something like three or four days sail west. But if you look there, there is a sunken land mast that sunk at the end of the last ice age because of the rapidly rising sea level, and this has been well established by marine geology, looking at evidence that the Asos Plateau underwent an isostatic subsidence, which would have been resulting from the rapidly rising sea level. We know there’s no doubt that the North American continent has rebounded isostatically after the removal of this tremendous mass of ice that mantled North America up to anywhere from 1000 to possible 1500 feet.If you do a comparable isostatic adjustment of the mid Atlantic ridge, you’ll find that the Asos island complex are much larger and it turns out that that might actually be a nice place to develop at least a maritime culture, something along the lines of the Phoenicians or the Manoans, during the period of the ice age, because during the period of the ice age, the climate of the world was so much different than now.The great basin area was filled with huge lakes, vegetation forest, savanna and grasslands. Like Graham said, with the lowered sea level, there were much larger areas of the coastline that were exposed. That’s probably where most of people would have resided during the ice ages, near the coastlines, because that would have been the most benevolent place. With the rising of the sea level, all of that’s lost. There’s nothing really fringed about saying, people might have lived on islands in the mid-Atlantic, especially when we know that those islands most likely had a benevolent climate during the ice age. I don’t go into crystal technology and flying machines, or whatever —"
"[INPUT]: Me neither. Me neither.Randall. Or all of the speculative stuff that has accredited to it, but if we just keep it simple and say, is it possible that a culture along the lines of the Manoan or the Phoenician, could have existed? Could have they existed on an island culture in the mid-Atlantic? There’s nothing really extreme about that idea, in my mind."
"[INPUT]: Even the idea that a more advanced sophisticated technological culture co-existed with hunter gatherers, isn’t too strange."
[INPUT]: We do so in the 20th century.
"[INPUT]: We do so today. We coexist with hunter gatherers in the Amazon jungle who don’t even know we exist. I don’t see why a priory, that’s just an impossible idea to look at."
"[INPUT]: Am I mis-remembering that in your book, you mentioned Indonesia as site for Atlantis?"
"[INPUT]: I mentioned Gunung Padang, not as a site for Atlantis. That’s Danny Hillman [inaudible 02If you go back to the end of the ice age, you’re not looking at the Malaysia Peninsula. You’re not looking at the Indonesia islands going out towards the Philippines. You’re looking at a giant continent size land mast, all of which went under water at the end of the last ice age, really rather rapidly.I think he has a point. It’s one of those areas in the world where there was very large scale flooding. Huge amounts of land were swallowed up. Also, Sahel, the connection of Australia to New Guinea was also washed away. There’s a whole range of issues regarding sea level rise in that very area, which anybody with an interest in these subjects should be paying attention to."
"[Joe Rogan]: So it’s quite possible that like today, many of the advance civilizations of today are on the water, whether it’s New York or Los Angeles, and that was probably the case back then, so the idea of Atlantis might not have been about one particular area, but many advanced areas that were wiped out along with their knowledge."
"[INPUT]: This is the thesis of that book mentioned, Noah’s flood, that the two geologists with the Black Sea theory, that it was rimmed with small villages and a massive flooding almost instantly wiped out, and then that gets passed down as the oral traditions of these myths. To me that seems totally reasonable."
[Joe Rogan]: Totally reasonable.
"[INPUT]: Why don’t we get into more discussion about the actual impact hypothesis and the mega flooding, so that we get our guys om standby, get them involved."
"[Joe Rogan]: What does your geologist, your geologist, since you’re by yourself and there’s two of them… It’s only fair, right? What does your geologist oppose to what Randall and Graham are proposing?"
"[INPUT]: I think it’s on the impact hypothesis versus the multiple glacial dams that burst of over period of time, like I had that slide."
[Joe Rogan]: Let’s call him up and get him on Skype. We’ve never done this before so this might suck. Hopefully it will work.
"[INPUT]: This slide here, he was showing these are each independent carbon 14 dates of these different instant floods in North America, from each individual ice stamps —"
[Joe Rogan]: What separates these dates? They are separated by?
"[INPUT]: Looks like from 20,000 to 12,000, so all before the impact."
"[Joe Rogan]: 12,800 wasn’t that —"
[INPUT]: Mark’s on the line.
[Joe Rogan]: Mark’s on the line. Mark can you hear us?
"[INPUT]: Yes, I can hear you."
[INPUT]: Mike Defunct.
[Joe Rogan]: Mark Defunct. Thank you very much for doing this. We really appreciate you coming on here.
[INPUT]: My pleasure.
[Joe Rogan]: You’ve had a chance to listen to these guys talk. What is your thoughts just stepping into this cold?
"[INPUT]: First of all, I did not mean to upset Mr. Hancock. He seemed to be quite disturbed and I want to apologize if I’ve disturbed him."
"[INPUT]: No, you haven’t disturbed me and I’m not upset. It’s just simply that you’re extremely selective in what you present in your admittedly draft article that you’ve chosen to put online. You don’t represent me accurately."
"[INPUT]: Let me go ahead and answer his question, because I know we’re getting short on time here."
"[Joe Rogan]: No, we have plenty of time. We have plenty of time."
"[INPUT]: Okay. First of all, would you allow me just to address Gobekli Tepe for a minute?"
[Joe Rogan]: Sure. Would you like to address the article first? I think that probably would be the most fair since we just brought that up.
[INPUT]: Okay. I’m sorry. What was the question then?
[Joe Rogan]: Graham?
[INPUT]: I read out on air various passages in your article where you misrepresent me.
"[INPUT]: No, I didn’t."
[INPUT]: Sorry?
"[INPUT]: No, I didn’t misrepresent you."
[INPUT]: You didn’t misrepresent me? Okay.
"[INPUT]: In fact, you said that I said that I was actually talking about someone in Indonesia, when I said you didn’t understand Newton’s physics."
"[INPUT]: No, I’m sorry. I didn’t say you were talking about someone in Indonesia. I said you were talking about Jesus Gamarra in Peru, is who I was talking about. Jesus Gamarra does have very exotic views on gravitation, which I state seriously are not my interest. I do say he may be right, but I don’t say he’s right. I say this is not my interest. I go on to say what my interest in his work. You pick on that —"
"[INPUT]: Excuse me, you’re drowning me our here. I was asked to explain whether or not I thought I was misleading. I don’t think I was misleading. You clearly state in there that maybe gravity was due to the way we’ve changed orbits around the sun. Gravity is not die to that. It’s due to mass and the inverse of —"
"[INPUT]: No, I don’t state that."
[INPUT]: What do you mean.
[INPUT]: I don’t state that. Jesus Gamarra states that and I say I disagree with it.
[INPUT]: I caught you in there.
[INPUT]: I say I disagree with it.
"[INPUT]: Oh, come on. I want to be respectful. I can’t really hear you when I’m talking. I apologize, but I feel like you are selectively changing the meaning of what I’m saying."
"[INPUT]: Why don’t you quote me as these words from my text? When you say that I buy the gravity thing of Jesus Gamarra, why don’t you quote me when I say —"
[INPUT]: Come on.
[Joe Rogan]: Hold on.
[INPUT]: This is just the opposite of that.
"[INPUT]: When I go on to say, not quoted in the attack is the following, “However, this isn’t the part of his theory I’m interested in. Where I feel he is solidly persuasive, is in his observations of the anomalous character of the monuments of the Andies.” I am not pinning anything on Jesus Gamarra’s gravitational ideas."
[INPUT]: I know you’re not.
"[INPUT]: I am saying very clearly what it is in his approach, that I am interested in. I’m not going to dismiss all of his approach because he has an approach on gravity that you don’t like. That’s not even of interest to me, and I say so in the book. You don’t report that, therefore I suggest you misrepresent me."
"[INPUT]: Mr. Hancock, what I brought up him for was simply to state that you didn’t understand, and I say it right there, that you don’t understand Newton’s physics."
[INPUT]: But I’m not even talking about Newton’s physics.
[INPUT]: So how will we take you seriously as a scientist is you don’t understand Newton’s simple physics?
[INPUT]: I am not talking about —
[INPUT]: The laws of Newton. For heaven’s sake.
"[INPUT]: If I wished to make an argument about gravity, I wouldn’t go saying that that isn’t the part of Jesus Gamarra’s theory that I’m interested in. I’m interested in the other aspect of his work. His observations through years of field work."
"[INPUT]: My point wasn’t that. My point was simply to point out that you didn’t understand Newton mechanics. We’re not talking about this guy,"
[INPUT]: You’re completely wasting time here.
"[INPUT]: Everybody stop. Graham, the way the article is —"
"[Joe Rogan]: Michael, hold on a second. Let these guys talk it out."
"[INPUT]: We did misrepresent him. We did. The way the sentence is structured, it’s clearly out of context. We’re going to change that."
[INPUT]: Yeah. I was taken out of context and that’s what I’m objecting to.
"[INPUT]: Mark, I’m not sure why he included it in the book in the first place, but he’s not arguing about gravity at all. We will fix that. Maybe we can get straight to the flooding thing that Randall was talking about."
"[Joe Rogan]: As long as Graham is fine with that. Graham, I know there was something else that you objected to."
"[INPUT]: The other thing that I find to be misrepresenting is there a statement, “Yet Hancock makes the following stunning claim, “Our ancestors are being initiated into the secrets of metals and how to make swords and knives.”” What Mark Defunct does not tell his readers, is that I make that claim… I don’t make that claim. I am actually reporting what is said in The Book of Enoch. That’s not me who said that, that’s the Book of Enoch.”"
"[INPUT]: We will fix that. Graham, we’ll fix that."
"[INPUT]: Okay. Otherwise, let’s get back to the main meat of this for god-sake."
[INPUT]: Just give me the list of things and we’ll fix it.
[INPUT]: I will.
[INPUT]: Because that’s not the point of that.
"[Joe Rogan]: Mark, you’re obviously very critical of Graham’s work, and maybe erroneously so. But let’s get to what you think about what you’ve heard so far."
"[INPUT]: All right Mr. Rogan. I don’t want to come across as a pompous scientist. What I want to do is I want to protect people from these grandiose assumptions. Mr. Hancock, in his first book —"
[INPUT]: Please call me Graham. Please call me Graham.
"[INPUT]: Okay. Graham, in his first book, in Fingerprints, suggested that there was a continent where the civilization lived, and through machinations, this continent went south and ended up destroying that civilization. As a geologist, that’s just nonsense.Now he comes back and he wants us to believe that he was all wrong, and then all of a sudden it’s okay now to believe in comet strikes that killed this famous civilization that’s supposed to exist. This is duping people. I don’t know if he means to do it, but he certainly seems to be duping people."
"[INPUT]: Mark, all my work is in print and online. I gather that you see your role as a protector for the public. Obviously you feel that the public are not intelligent enough to make discerning decisions of their own, in this respect. However, to address —"
[INPUT]: I’m saying that the public doesn’t understand the science to the degree that you’re misrepresenting it.
[INPUT]: So they need the superior knowledge of Mark Defunct in order to understand it. Fine.
"[INPUT]: No, I think they need the knowledge of science, not knowledge that I have."
"[INPUT]: It’s okay. Let me come to your point, which is you are saying that I proposed one mechanism for cataclysm in Fingerprints of the Gods, and that I’m proposing another mechanism for cataclysm today. What I proposed in Fingerprints of the Gods was that there had been a gigantic cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,500 years ago.I looked at a number of possibilities, of which the most striking to me at the time was earth crust displacement, and earth crust displacement is reported as the work of Charles Hapgood, not my work, but I do report it in Fingerprints of the Gods as an excellent theory, which explains the information. Since I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, I’ve learned a lot. I’ve learned a lot and I wouldn’t want to defend that theory strongly today.I don’t know if you have bought the latest edition of my book, the paperback edition of Magicians of the Gods, but it contains a chapter saying whatever happened to earth crust displacement? I address the change of view in this, and I think I have a right to change my view and I think it’s healthy that…Why would I stick permanently to a view that I held in 1995, if new evidence persuades me that it’s wrong? I’m sure that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Fundamental proposition is we had a massive global cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,500 years ago, so naturally, it’s of great interest to me when a large group of scientists, more than 60 of them, over a period of more than 10 years now, present evidence of a massive comet impact event 12,800 years ago, exactly in window I proposed."
"[INPUT]: Graham, you are implying that there are a lot of people out there that believe in this. There are some people that believe in it, I agree, but for the most part, I think taking an honest view, the comet hypothesis has gotten debunked."
"[INPUT]: That’s complete rubbish, Mark. That’s complete rubbish."
"[INPUT]: By the way, I would also point out that in finger prints, you had people believing that the end of the world was coming in 2012. How am I supposed to take you seriously when you say things like that and then change your mind? We could all be dead by now if we believed you."
"[INPUT]: Yes. I have absolutely changed my mind on the Mayan calendar. I regard the Mayan calendar as an interesting technological artifact with a better estimate of the length of the solar year than the estimate that we have with today. The Mayan calendar is based primarily on the position of the sun amongst the constellations at the winter solstice.We are in an 80-year window when the sun sits astride the dark rift of the milky way, between the constellation of Sagittarius and Scorpio, on the winter solstice. That window is 80 years wide, so he story of the Mayan calendar by the way isn’t actually quite over yet, but I’m not —"
[INPUT]: Do you know what procession means?
"[INPUT]: Yes, I know exactly what procession means."
"[INPUT]: Okay. Well, all of this stuff that you claim is on a procession, a procession is the earth spinning like a top."
[INPUT]: Don’t teach grandma to suck eggs.
"[INPUT]: It has nothing to do with running through comet clouds, and yet, you’re saying that somehow, we’re on some sort of cycle, where the comets are going to come back and strike the earth right now, sometime during the next 40 years. That’s what you said in Magicians."
"[INPUT]: No, that’s what Victor Clube and Bill Napier and Emilio Spedicato are saying."
[INPUT]: Don’t blame this on other people.
[INPUT]: I’m a reporter.
[INPUT]: You’re the one that said it in your book. You just got all over Michael Shermer for saying the same things about other people. I want to know what you think. You tell me what you think.
"[INPUT]: Mark, I am a reporter and I make it very clear in the [crosstalk 02"
[INPUT]: You’re talking about science.
[Joe Rogan]: Mark we can’t talk over each other like this.
"[INPUT]: I am a reporter and it is my job to report the work of other people, and I report the work of Victor Clube, Bill Napier and Emilio Spedicato, all of whom draw attention to the torrid meteor stream and who regard it as the greatest collision hazard facing the earth, at this time, and who specifically indicate that we may run into a filament of the torrid meteor stream in the next 30 years, that is going to be very bad for our civilization. It’s not my —"
[INPUT]: It has nothing to do with procession?
[INPUT]: When did I say it had anything to do with procession?
[INPUT]: You have a whole section on procession in Magicians of the God.
"[INPUT]: Indeed, as a clock, as a timer, as a way of going back through the ages, but I’m not saying procession is causing this encounter with the torrid meteor stream. Go find the paragraph where I said that."
"[INPUT]: No. What you’re saying is that we’re on a cycle, that 12,000 years ago, civilization was destroyed and now you’re saying that civilization was so smart, that they knew we were going to go through another shower and we’re all doomed in the next 40 years, but you didn’t say doomed in Magicians like you did in Fingerprints, but we must conclude that that’s your opinion, because I don’t know anybody else that you’ve referenced on that issue, but procession has nothing to do with that. It’s not even that cycle. It has a cycle of about 21,000 years so your cycles are even off of procession."
"[INPUT]: 25,920 actually, for a procession."
[INPUT]: That is not a procession.
"[INPUT]: One degree every 72 years, give or take a small margin. That is the procession. You’re really teaching grandma how to suck eggs here."
"[INPUT]: Anyway, I guess this has just been going on all day. You can’t criticize Michael for bringing up other people that are saying strange things and comparing it to you and say, “Oh no. You can’t say that because it’s not about me. It’s not true.” You’re doing the same thing. You’re reporting about other people and saying nonsense."
"[INPUT]: I am reporting the work of Victor Clube, Bill Napier and Emilio Spedicato."
[INPUT]: That’s what Michael’s doing.
[INPUT]: I also indicate that I strongly support that work. That’s as far as I go.
"[Joe Rogan]: Mark, if I could stop you here, you think that this comet wiping out all the ice age megafauna theory has been debunked? Is that what you’re saying?"
"[INPUT]: No sir. I have not said that, but I think that if you read the literature carefully, the majority of scientists right now, and I know that this is still a go, and you know what I like about the comet people, is that they’re doing it in the scientifically right way. They’re getting people to review the material, they’re getting people to go through that [goblin 02Firestone did this is 2007, he was crucified. His group has comeback with a lot of good stuff. I want to wait and see this play out. I said that in that my paper, that we’re going to have to wait to get a conclusion here. I’m not saying that they’re wrong, but right now, if I read the literature, as a scientist, I have to say that the comet guys are getting hit pretty hard."
[INPUT]: What do you make of the latest platinum paper in Nature’s scientific reports? The platinum anomaly across North America and its coincident in time with the Greenland ice cores and the platinum anomaly there? What do you say to that?
"[INPUT]: I say that, and maybe we can bring him on, the problem with that is that what’s his platinum have to do with the comet? Platinums are high in asteroids, but they’re not high in comets. Comets are icy bodies. I saw the paper. I read it. I think it’s interesting but I can’t, for the life of me, figure out how he’s correlating it."
[INPUT]: 20
"[INPUT]: Let’s bring Malcolm on, since he’s one of the co-authors of the platinum paper."
[Joe Rogan]: This is going to get super complicated.
[INPUT]: Let’s try.
[Joe Rogan]: We can only do one caller at a time apparently.
[INPUT]: I think Malcolm should have his voice heard.
[INPUT]: I don’t want to criticize if he can’t be here.
"[Joe Rogan]: That’s okay, Mark."
[INPUT]: He can be here.
"[INPUT]: What I’d like to do is go back and talk a little bit, if I may, about Gobekli Tepe, because I’ve read Schmidt. I know that Schmidt never ever found anything to suggest that there were anything in the early part of Gobekli Tepe, that were not hunter gatherers. They all were hunter gatherers. I think I may be wrong on this, but I think he found 22,000 stone tools there when he dug that place up."
[INPUT]: I’m not disputing that.
"[INPUT]: He never found any domesticated animals, he never found any domesticated grain. He found tons of bones of animals, so we know that about 100–200 people were probably working on Gobekli Tepe at one time, and they were fed by wild animals and grain.There’s no reason to go out on a limb here and say that some magical civilization came in. By the way, that’s another thing that drives me crazy. You’re saying that these guys were magicians. You’re saying that they had secret knowledge. What possible secret knowledge did they give to the people at Gobekli Tepe? How can you possibly say things like that?"
"[INPUT]: Again, I’m not saying that. The word Magicians of the Gods come from the Apkallu in ancient Sumer, and they were considered to have superior powers and they were considered to be magicians of a sort. Should I not report that because it’s there in the scenario in text?"
"[INPUT]: No. I think you should tell us what Michael’s been asking all day, is what were their super powers."
"[INPUT]: I’m not saying that they had super powers. It’s the Sumerians who said that. I simply report that. You can regard that as a cop out if you like, but I am a fucking reporter."
[INPUT]: Why did you call your book Magician of the Gods?
[INPUT]: Because that’s the direct implication of the Apkallu. They were the magicians of the gods.
[INPUT]: I know. It sounds like you’re saying they had magical powers to me.
"[INPUT]: No, I’m, saying that they were the magicians of the gods as they were called in an ancient culture. That’s all I’m saying."
"[INPUT]: Okay, I just want your audience to know that Schmidt, who worked there for 20 years, that didn’t go there for two days and look around, take some notes and leave and write a book on it, he worked there for 20 years and he found, with dates and everything, he found that there were hunter gatherers there building those megaliths. If you went to Easter Island, and you found the Moai, and you said, “Oh my gosh. There must have been some secret civilization that made these moai, because stupid hunter gatherers couldn’t possible make these,” when we know that there were no special people on Easter Island. It had to be made by hunter gatherers. Why would you poopoo the Gobekli Tepe and have to call a civilization did that?"
[INPUT]: Are you seriously saying that the inhabitants of Easter Island were hunter gatherers?
"[INPUT]: Absolutely. A matter of fact, we can see the population of the Pacific Ocean."
"[INPUT]: So on that little island, they had no agriculture? Are you saying that?"
[INPUT]: [crosstalk 02
"[Joe Rogan]: Hold on a second. Mark, hold on a second. Mark, please let him respond. Go ahead."
"[INPUT]: First of all, did you meet Klaus Schmidt? Do you know him personally?"
[INPUT]: You know he’s dead and you know that I haven’t met him.
[INPUT]: Okay. I did meet him. I do know him personally.
[INPUT]: I know you did.
"[INPUT]: I did record my interviews with him, with his agreement, and what he states, I don’t disagree with you that the people around Gobekli Tepe were hunter gatherers when Gobekli Tepe was started. What precisely intrigued Klaus Schmidt was the possibility, his phrase nit mine, that Gobekli Tepe was a center of innovation.A place where new ideas were deliberately seeded and spread out in the population. I have Klaus Schmidt on record saying that. I quote him saying that in my book, and that, to me, is a very interesting proposition because it suggest that we have a site here that is being used to mobilize the population and to transfer to them the knowledge of agriculture, which suddenly appears around Gobekli Tepe, at the time that Gobekli Tepe is functioning."
[INPUT]: What do you mean by sudden?
[INPUT]: Can I add to that?
"[INPUT]: What I mean by suddenly is Klaus Schmidt stated very clearly that these are the people, the very same people who made Gobekli Tepe, in Klaus Schmidt’s view, are the people who “invented agriculture”."
"[Joe Rogan]: If you don’t mind me interrupting here for a second, what about Easter Island? Was Easter Island established by hunter gatherers or not? You were saying not?"
"[INPUT]: You say it was established by hunter gatherers. I say not. I say Easter Island was an agricultural society. What’s there to hunt and gather on a tiny island? Have you been to Easter Island? I have, six times. You can walk across it in three hours. What’s there to hunt and gather on that?"
"[INPUT]: You’re misunderstanding my point. My point is these are not sophisticated people. I want to go back and agree with you on Gobekli Tepe. I think that you got Schmidt right. In fact, it’s a UNESCO site. We all recognize how important it is, but what I think Michael and I can’t understand is how this ties into some magnificent civilization. There’s nothing there that indicates that they were influenced by some other civilization. They started out as hunter gatherers and then they evolved into a agricultural society, and that’s what makes it a great site."
"[INPUT]: Can I answer you? You’re seriously saying that there’s nothing there? The largest megalithic site on earth, 7,000 years older than Stonehenge is there. There’s no background to it, no evidence of practice or trade at the megalithic site itself, is the problem for me."
"[INPUT]: Honestly, we’ve got megaliths in quite a few sites, and by the way, you’re right. There’s a megalith just down the road from Gobekli Tepe, and there probably several other. I can see them on the maps."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, we need to get to the bottom of this."
[INPUT]: We’ve got a wonderful amount of work to do there.
[INPUT]: You bet.
"[INPUT]: I think Graham, we’re in good agreement on this."
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay, so you guys are in agreement on that."
"[INPUT]: What I want to point out is, is that I don’t think that there’s any need to call upon this great civilization that you say exists."
"[INPUT]: To me, the simplest explanation is a transfer of knowledge, a transfer of technology. I’ve been writing about the possibility of a lost civilization for more than quarter of a century, that’s what I do. I hope that it’s a useful contribution to the debate. Archaeologists can chose not listen to anything I say to dismiss me as complete lunatic as they often do, to accuse me as you do in writing, of duping the public, of conning the public, and so on and so forth —Mark; I didn’t use the word conning."
"[INPUT]: You did use the word conning, actually. It’s in the very last paragraph of your article because I’ve got it right here in front of me."
[INPUT]: We will fix that.
"[INPUT]: Michael, this is the first thing I wrote. I just put it up for my students."
"[INPUT]: Well, it’s there."
[INPUT]: It won’t come out in the paper.
[Joe Rogan]: Hold on a second.
"[INPUT]: Exact words. “What I’m left with is that Hancock…” I’m going to put my reading glasses on so I can read this properly. “What I am left with,” this is quoting you Mark, “Is that Hancock has a real knack for conning a hellacious number or people into buying his books.”"
[INPUT]: That’s not right.
[INPUT]: That’s a direct insult. It’s online in your article. Do you stand by it or not?
[INPUT]: Listen. I apologize to you for the use of that language. Is that what you wanted? Because I do. I did not mean to attack you first.
[INPUT]: I’m sorry you used it in the first place. I think you’re misleading your students.
"[Joe Rogan]: Why would you say that you’re just putting that online for your students, as if that’s not a big deal? You’re putting it on the internet. To say you’re just putting online for your students and you’ve been proven incorrect, how many different times in this article now?Graham; About seven."
[INPUT]: Proven incorrect? I haven’t been proven incorrect?
"[INPUT]: Well, you have. You misquote me. You don’t give the context and —"
[INPUT]: I’m not the guy that said the world was going to end in 2012.
[INPUT]: Even Michael has said that the Skeptic article will not reflect these out of context statements that you’re making here.
"[INPUT]: The core is, is the impact hypothesis likely to be true or not, and as an independent phenomenon, is it connected to Gobekli Tepe and the younger Dryas? That’s kind of what we’re getting at. Maybe you can explain that graph that shows all the glacial dam bursts and the dating of those as thousands of years before the 12,800 year impact."
[INPUT]: Can we put the map up first? We need the map up first.
[INPUT]: Then you guys can get into what does that mean.
[INPUT]: Which map is that?
[Joe Rogan]: Which map? Which map Mark?
[INPUT]: I’m sorry. It’s the glacial map of Western Washington or Washington State in Oregon.
[INPUT]: I’ll show you what it looks like.
[Joe Rogan]: Jamie will put it up.
[INPUT]: This map.
"[INPUT]: By the way, to protect Michael here, I submitted this, Michael made immense amount of changes on that paper. I put it up because I wanted my students to see it. I had no idea that people would go online and look at that like you. Unfortunately, you’ve sent tens of thousands of people probably to it by letting them know it’s on here and I’m sorry for that."
[Joe Rogan]: But why is it okay to just put that up online for your students?
[INPUT]: I don’t get that.
"[Joe Rogan]: How come you don’t have any problem with that, but you do have a problem with it as it stands, being released to the general public?"
[INPUT]: Maybe he’s looking for feedback.
[INPUT]: I stand by everything I said except for the personal comment at the end.
[INPUT]: We’ll see if that survives the editing process.
[INPUT]: Let’s take a look at this map.
[Joe Rogan]: Let’s put up this map.
[INPUT]: Let’s get up back to the map.
"[INPUT]: Okay. The brown areas are, I have to emphasize that the [scatlands 02I guess my point here is is that you guys want to make the flooding out here to be immense. I think Bretz’s original idea was that there was just one flooding, but then Bretz came to understand, after looking at the data and all of the geologic work, that it wasn’t just one flood, that’s it’s many floods, and that was the point of all of those dates that I show you, that there have been at least 17 specific floods dates.There probably as many as 40 to 50 floods out there, and they’re all probably related to glacial dams breaking. Where in the world would you ever say that this small area, relative to a entire continent, why would you say that this is evidence for a comet strike? Not even the comet guys are saying that this flooding out here is related to a comet, because there are a large number of… A very small number of actual area that is flooded. If you take a look now at the dates… Do you have that Michael? The one with the —"
"[Joe Rogan]: We’re going to bring that up, but let’s let Randall Carlson address you now because he’s the one who’s the expert of this."
"[INPUT]: He’s got a point, that if you confine your examination to this area, but the point is, is you’ve got evidence of megaflooding all around the ice sheet margin, from the Atlantic, to the pacific. You’ve got the work of [Kihu and Lord 02You have glacial River Warren that was undoubtedly formed by most likely glacial Lake Agassiz, and you’ve got the St. Croix Rive where I took Graham a couple of years ago, that had mega floods down. There were mega floods down the Mississippi River. There was glacial Lake Wisconsin that discharged down the Wisconsin River, left the Wisconsin dells. There were the Finger Lakes in New York that probably were created by massive emanating off of —"
"[INPUT]: No, they were scoured."
"[INPUT]: Scoured, exactly. Right. They were scoured and they were probably scoured by sub-glacial floods that were coming under high pressure. You have the drumlin fields that are just the south of them. You’ve probably seen the work of John Sean, Claire Beanie and Bruce Reiner knows out of Canada."
[INPUT]: I think Sean’s idea about drumlins in crazy.
[INPUT]: Why would that be? How do you propose the drumlins then were formed?
[INPUT]: Easily. The glaciers came forward and topped the terminal marine and spread the marines out in the drumlins.
"[INPUT]: But how? You’ve got features that look like they’re totally fluvially produced. They look like inverted boatels. You look at the internal stratification, how does glaciers create internal stratification? I’ve looked at numerous drumlins in Canada, I’ve looked at Drumlins in New York State, I’ve looked at Drumlins in probably a dozen different places, and where you can see exposures, you see stratification. You don’t see, if glaciers are grinding over a deformable sub-strait, how is it that they produce anything other than a chaotic jumble of glacial till?"
[INPUT]: You can actually see layers. I’ve seen it myself and we can pull pictures of it here in a minute. I’d like for you to explain to me —
"[INPUT]: Before you do that, because I’m not disagreeing with you. A drumlin, by definition, is made up of till. I think we’re getting kind of technical for this audience, but as eschar is something that’s stratified, not a drumlin. You’re misidentifying them as drumlins."
"[INPUT]: No, I am not misidentifying drumlins. I know very clearly the different between an eschar and a drumlin. I’ve looked at many eschars. I’ve hiked on, I’ve flown over them in airplanes."
[INPUT]: Certainly you must agree that the finger lakes are gouged?
"[INPUT]: They are gouged, yes. Are they gouged by glaciers or are they also gouged by sub-glacial megafloods?That’s the question and I think that’s a fair question to ask. If we look at some of the studies, we find out that the depositional material in them is massive. It’s not stratified. It’s massive, as if it was dumped in there over a very short period of time."
[INPUT]: Let me go back to the bigger picture.
[Joe Rogan]: Hold on a second. What’s your point about that?
"[INPUT]: Sorry Joe, I can’t hear you."
"[Joe Rogan]: Respond to that, what he just said."
"[INPUT]: What am I responding to? Oh, look. We’re going to have to disagree. I don’t want to get in an argument with him here. He thinks that they’re done by water, I think that traditionally, the way most geologists see the finger lakes is they’re gouged out. They’re parallel to one another. If he thinks it’s water, okay. What can we do? We can disagree I guess. Let me go back up to the main glacier."
[INPUT]: 36
"[INPUT]: What he backed off of was the idea that the draining of glacial Lake Agassiz, triggered the Younger Dryas. Because the dating of the draining of glacial Lake Agassiz, was post Younger Dryas. That’s what he backed off of. He didn’t necessarily back off. Look, we know that they were somewhere around —"
"[INPUT]: He knows that the marines have been carefully… They’ve been carefully mapped, you can wash the Laurentide Glacier, move back , marine after marine and there are no holes in that marine that suggest flooding. There’s no change in the lake level of Lake Agassiz. There’s no evidence there Randall for flooding. You’ve got it wrong, if you look at the mapping, the careful mapping that the geologists have done."
"[INPUT]: You’ve just said that there was no change in the level of Lake Agassiz. How is that possible? As the ice receded, the glacial Lake Agassiz expanded, and some point, it finally breached right there by Big Stone Lake in Minnesota, and basically carved out the Minnesota River Valley, which geological studies have confirmed, they call River Warren, and have confirmed that essentially, it was carrying… It’s discharge was roughly 4,000 times greater than the modern Minnesota River that flows there.Where did that end up? That flowed down into the Mississippi, the Mississippi then conveyed that water into the Gulf of Mexico and deposited huge amounts of delta material that New Orleans is built on now."
"[INPUT]: You know, you’re trying to make a flood where a flood isn’t. There’s a difference between a glacial melting, which causes a lot of water, and a comet strike, in which case that creates copious amounts of water. I think you guys referred to it the last time as a tsunami. There’s no evidence of a tsunami in North America.By the way, here’s another question. Why are you guys talking about North America when your Atlantis is supposed to be in Egypt or you guys have run around, you’ve found some evidence of flooding in North America, and somehow, this relates to a destruction of Atlantis and some lost civilization."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s not Randall. That’s not Randall.
"[INPUT]: Forget that. That’s not what I’m talking about right now. I’m not talking about that. We know there was a fennoscandian ice sheet, we know there was a cordilleran ice sheet, we know there was a Laurentide ice sheet. We know they all melted. We know that there was somewhere around six million cubic miles of ice wrapped up in those ice sheets, at the lake glacial maximum.They’re all gone now. They had to melt. That was an enormous amount of water. I don’t know if you have been out to the scab-lands. I’ve been going back to the scab-lands and the area of Glacial Lake Missoula since 1970. I’ve been across that thing 60,000 miles, back and forth. I have over 10,000 photographs of the material in the field, and I can tell you, those floods were enormous. They were beyond —"
"[INPUT]: You and your cherry-picking. Look at the map. You’ve shown some pictures. You know we can measure those current ripple marks that these show, we can measure how much water went over them, all you have to do is measure the current ripples."
[INPUT]: You can go into camas prairie and you’ve got a current ripple field there that is about seven miles long —
[INPUT]: I know. I know it very well.
"[INPUT]: Okay. The high water marking there is at 4200 feet above sea level. The floor of camas prairie is just 1400 feet lower than that, so we know that there were 1400 feet of water that passed through camas prairie and down into the [inaudible 02"
[INPUT]: No. Because you’re not considering the erosion that took place.
[INPUT]: No we don’t? Are you disregarding the high water marks?
"[INPUT]: From the bottom of the canyon to the top of the canyon is not what it was when the water first started flowing in that area. You can’t take the bottom of the canyon and say there must have 4,000 feet of water here."
"[INPUT]: I’m not talking about a canyon. I’m talking about camas prairie basin, which is not a canyon. It’s a basin, which is not a canyon. It’s a basin."
[INPUT]: It had to erode upon time.
"[INPUT]: Well, most of the material in there was washed in, so we don’t know how much it would have eroded, until somebody does some core samples to get down to something that can be dated to earlier than the late glacial maximum, but the floor of camas prairie is thick layers of very coarse gravel boulders, and this is what composes the current ripples that you see there.I don’t see how you can look at those current ripples that are sometimes 40 and 50 feet in amplitude, with two and three hundred cord lengths and say that that wasn’t a catastrophic flow. Maybe it wasn’t —"
"[INPUT]: It was a catastrophic flow, but it wasn’t like a tsunami."
[INPUT]: Then how would you characterize then?
"[INPUT]: We can play this game, but every geologist on the planet practically says that there were about 40 different floods until you came along and now you’re trying to refute this because somebody told you a [crosstalk 02"
"[INPUT]: You’re not familiar with the work of Victor Baker or Russel Bunker or a number of others that have changed the 40 floods hypothesis. You can tell me that those current ripples in camas prairie, they’re the product of 40 separate floods?"
"[INPUT]: Absolutely. In fact, when you showed me your pictures, I could see the flow of changes in that… Don’t give me the, “You’re incredulous,” stuff. Being incredulous doesn’t mean you’re right."
[INPUT]: You do the incredulous all the time Mark.
[INPUT]: That’s because you say some pretty incredulous things Graham.
[INPUT]: 40 floods created the camas prairie. That’s what you’re saying? That’s the product of 40 separate floods?
"[INPUT]: I don’t know how many floods have been in there. I know that they’re counting them, and I last read something to the effect of 40, somewhere around there."
[INPUT]: Yeah. That’s based on the work of Richard [Wade 02
[INPUT]: Go to his graph. Can we go to his graph?
[INPUT]: Whose graph? Which graph is this Mark?
[INPUT]: It’s the one right below the map.
[INPUT]: This one. It’s the dating of the floods.
[Joe Rogan]: Here we go. We’re at that right now.
"[INPUT]: Randall, hopefully we’re disagreeing as comrades here rather than fighting each other."
[INPUT]: I think so. Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I’m just trying to give you some data here. Look at those. Those are Missoula floods, Lake Missoula. He’s got them dated. You’re seeing the dates. He’s got standard deviations, one and two standard deviations on the median thee. We’ve got these things pinned by multiple carbon dates.The little bell curves there show how many carbon dates he’s got. You can see that these are documented very well, so I don’t understand why you’re so opposed to multiple floods. In fact, I heard in the last time you guys were on this show, I heard you say that you thought there were multiple floods. Now you’re trying to argue against that idea. What’s going on?"
"[INPUT]: No, I am not. I still think there were multiple floods. I think we have to look at two distinct regimes of floods though. As far as the radio carbon dating, the thing we have to be really careful of is that floods will en-train older sediment, and in that older sediment, there could be radio carbon dated material that doesn’t really date the time of the flood, but was excavated by the flood, en-trained in the flood waters and then redeposited.That’s a major problem with radio carbon dating any time you look at flood sediments. I do believe there were multiple floods. I think it’s a misinterpretation to think that I only think that there was one flood. The problem is here, and I do, I think we’re colleagues, my approach to this is just like in the MMA when two guys get out there and try to beat the crap out of each other and then at the end of it, they give each other a hug. That’s kind of where I’m coming from. There’s nothing personal."
"[INPUT]: I’m sure we couldn’t give each other a hug, but I feel the same way. By the way you guys are very bright and very knowledgeable."
"[INPUT]: I really value this because I’m looking for holes in this idea, very much so. I have done some serious thinking about this over many years and I have interviewed most of the geologists that have worked on it.I’ve been in half a dozen field trips guided by the main geologists that have worked on this, and had a chance to dialogue with them. I’m convinced that there’s a lot to be learned about this. I think we need to be looking at, like you said, the big picture.We could get back to discussion of the finger lakes and how they formed. I think that’s important. I think we could get back to a discussion about drumlins and how they formed.There is studies on the valley heads more rained that are at the sound end of the finger lakes. I can’t think of who did it right now — I could pull it up — but basically said that it’s water deposited. But there’s a lot of unresolved issues about what happened during this planetary transition out of the last ice age, and I think it’s important that we have these discussions, that we have these dialogues, and we try to get to the bottom of what actually happened, without imposing too many preconceptions upon our models, because I think we’re looking at something very unprecedented here."
"[INPUT]: Randall, I couldn’t have said that better. It was very well articulated. Let me go back to the big picture, if I could, just for a minute, because I want to address something that Graham said earlier, and that is that Graham seems to have this idea that comets break up all the time.People that understand comets and meteorites understand that the comet shoemaker levy or whatever it was that broke up."
[INPUT]: Shoemaker levy 9.
"[INPUT]: It broke up because of the gravitation of Jupiter. We would not expect these comets to break up entering into the atmosphere, is one of the problems that the comet people have had. Firestone once suggested a four kilometer wide comet striking. Now, they’ve broken it up into multiple comets. The problem is, you can’t get it separated. If a comet break up, it’s very hard to separate it so that it hits in multiple places.This is a big picture kind of problem that the comet people are having with the scientists. You may be able to get it to hit the North American ice sheet, but I’m telling you that the studies are showing that you’re not going to be able to do this without leaving some marks, and so far, nobody’s been able to find a crater. Do you know that they’re suggesting that a four kilometer comet, if it could break up, it would generate one million meteor craters?You know how big that was? That was 49,000 years ago. We don’t see that in the climate record. 49,000 ago, we should see it. We don’t see it. It’s about barely a little thing. We’re going to have a huge comet strike."
"[INPUT]: Malcolm Lecomte has been standing by for the best part of three hours. Since he’s a member of the comet research group, wouldn’t it be a good time to bring him on?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, we can bring him on, as long as Mark is satisfied that he’s said his piece, but unfortunately Mark, we can’t have two people on the phone at the same time."
[INPUT]: Okay. I really appreciate you having me on Joe.
"[Joe Rogan]: I appreciate you coming on too and I’m glad you guys, especially you and Randall, seem to have ironed out a lot of your ideas."
[INPUT]: Randall’s a great guy.
"[Joe Rogan]: I think that there’s a lot to be learned here, obviously, and there’s a lot that already had been learned and this is an unbelievably fascinating subject. I think often times when these debates get heated, a lot gets lost in who’s wrong or who’s right, but I think what we can all agree on is that what we’re dealing with is an unbelievable point in history, and the history of this planet.Trying to figure out what caused it and why, is some really fascinating stuff, so Mark, I really appreciate your time and I really appreciate you imparting your knowledge on us."
[INPUT]: Well said Joe.
"[INPUT]: Mark, if at all possible, I would love to keep some of this dialogue going because I really would value your input."
[INPUT]: I tried to write you Randall and I couldn’t get through. I’m not sure why.
[Joe Rogan]: We’ll connect you guys.
"[INPUT]: I’m not either because I would have seen that, I would have seen that, I would definitely would have responded."
[Joe Rogan]: I’ll hook you up.
[INPUT]: I have website. Please send me. I’d love to keep up with it.
[INPUT]: I will.
[Joe Rogan]: We’ll definitely connect you guys after this is over. Thank you once again Mark. I really appreciate you.
"[INPUT]: Mark, if I can just say, I do hope you’ll revisit your article and just have a look at the context in which you present me then."
[INPUT]: Absolutely. Never meant to insult you.
[INPUT]: All right.
[Joe Rogan]: Thank you Mark. We are going to call caller number two. This is a fascinating podcast. Your friend who is?
[INPUT]: Malcolm Lecomte.
[Joe Rogan]: Malcolm Lecomte.
"[INPUT]: He’s one of the comet research group scientists. This is a large and diverse body of scientist who come at the material with different expertise and different areas of knowledge. It happens that Malcolm is a co-author of the recent, I regard it, highly significant paper, ‘Finding a Platinum Anomaly Across North America’. I would hope he might begin with addressing why that might indicate a comet impact."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Is Malcolm on?
"[INPUT]: He should be. Malcolm, can you hear us?"
[INPUT]: I can hear. Can you hear me?
[Joe Rogan]: Excellent. How are you Malcolm? Thank you very much for joining us.
[INPUT]: I’m happy to be here.
"[Joe Rogan]: Give us your thoughts on what Graham just said, if you would, as to why it makes sense that it was a comet that hit and why there would be these large deposits of these… What was it exactly?"
[INPUT]: Platinum in the recent paper.
[Joe Rogan]: Platinum and what else?
"[INPUT]: Malcolm is also an expert in magnetic microspherules and I think he can address that issue as well. The whole range of proxies, of impact proxies."
"[Joe Rogan]: Malcolm please, just give us your thoughts on this entire phenomenon, if you will."
"[INPUT]: I will. Happy to be here. Actually, I was very interested to hear Mark’s… His initial statement kind of put me off but his subsequent statements I thought were pretty accurate. There were many problems with the hypothesis that there was an impact, and that’s the way I consider. I don’t really think in terms of a comet impact, I think in terms of an extra-terrestrial impact, because I don’t think we’ve proven a comet impact.I don’t think we know what kind if an impact it was. There’s too many questions that have to be answered. I can’t sign up to say that I’m defending the comet impact hypothesis because I don’t frankly know what it was. We have a lot of evidence that appears to be extra-terrestrial in nature. We have magnetic microspherules.The most frequent criticism we get is that the evidence has not been replicated, and that’s where I thought Mark was going when he… His initial statement was that the comet impact hypothesis has been debunked. I think what he meant was, if I can speak for him, was that the fact that it was a comet has been debunked. I don’t think that’s necessarily true yet. It just is an indicator that it was a comet.We have indications that it was more of an asteroid than anything else. I can conceive of a rubble pile that somehow became disassociated or there had to be a mechanism or a model for that, and I don’t think we have a model for that. Asteroids come in many flavors and rubble piles are certainly one. Loose aggregates or material that could become separated possibly, but I just don’t know at this stage.The biggest criticism that we faced in terms in terms of the impact hypothesis is that the evidence has not been replicable. We now have three or four lines that have been replicated by numerous independent groups. If you look at the nano diamonds which may be the most controversial of the bunch of the evidence lines, that’s been replicated by four different groups, independent, five different studies.The magnetic microspherules, which were initially treated very hostilely, because they didn’t understand what we were talking about, and some of that was a self-inflicted wound of the part of the initial study, which didn’t show what we really were finding. That’s been corrected and yet the same objection or criticism is being made.Magnetic microspherules are typically very… They’re melted and then they’re quenched. They’re subjected to high temperatures and then those temperatures are rapidly reduced, which is short of accepting to be characteristics of an impact. We’ve got that evidence of an impact, and that’s been replicated by ten different independent groups, including many of the same sites that were originally disputed.The disputation has been largely based upon the failure to do the most basic part of the protocol, which is to do the scanning electro-microscopic analysis of the spherules. That is the microspherules and the nano diamonds.The other is the discovery of platinum, iridium or osmium, which are the platinum group elements, which are characteristic of an asteroid impact. We found some evidence of iridium, not a lot, but there have been certain sites that are rich in iridium, at the… Once again, this is at the Younger Dryas boundary, not above, not below. It’s there at that boundary, so they seem to be pretty solid."
"[Joe Rogan]: Iridium is indicative of an impact of extra-terrestrial origin, correct?"
"[INPUT]: That’s correct. The platinum is simply just another more plentiful platinum group element. Obviously, that’s why they’re called the platinum groups. Osmium is one that is usually associated with iridium. There are now 11 studies by independent groups, that have confirmed the occurrence of platinum, osmium or iridium. It looks to me like the evidence is piling up. The most recent one of course is the platinum study by Moore, that just came a few months ago."
"[Joe Rogan]: I’m sorry to interrupt you, but Randall Carlson just had us pull some images that we’re looking at. Randall, please explain what this is."
"[INPUT]: This is from Malcolm’s 2012 independent evaluation of conflicting microsperules results from different investigations. This is his supplementary information figure four. It’s just so that the people watching this can actually see what you’re talking about when you’re discussing the rapid quenching effect on the surface of the microspherules. We’ve got up on the screen here, supplementary information figure four, where you’ve got the microspherules from Topper, Blackwater Draw and Paw paw cove. Just so people can see what surface texture looks like."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. You see these, they look like leaf-like structures across. Some of them are harder to see to but they’re there. If you see the original image, it’s large enough and clear enough to actually see these, what we call dentritic structures or almost like a carpet weave. Those are essentially truncated crystallization.It’s a crystallization process that’s quenched. I’m not a geologist. I’ve had geologists try to explain this to me and that’s what I’m trying to do here, but the fact that these are enhanced, these things are quite enhanced at the Younger Dryas and really depleted above and below. There are spherules throughout the column.Any column of soil, when you go down vertically, deeper, you find sperules, but those spherules are typically what we call orthogenic, which means they were created by terrestrial processes. You need to do a scanning electro-microscope and x-ray, dispersive spectroscopy to differentiate those from the terrestrial process that are producing these things."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Your figure has a framboidal spherule, which is probably what you’re talking about. If you could go to slide 113, Jamie. There it is. You can see, very distinct difference. We’ve got your figure five up on the screen now, Malcolm."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. That’s a typical framboid. When you look at an optical microscope, they look just like the or very much like what we call impact spherules or magnetic microspherules, and they occur much more frequently. I’ve got sites that have tens of thousands of these things in every couple of centimeters of sediment, so you’ve got to separate the impact spherules or the magnetic microspherules from these things."
"[INPUT]: But what you appear to be saying Malcolm is there is an abundance of impact proxy evidence, which in your opinion, adds up to a cosmic impact of some sort, not necessarily a comet. You’re suggesting an asteroid. It’s a mysterious event in that sense, but what it adds up to is an impact in your view. Is that a fair summary?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. All these, what we call proxies, the impact sperules, the platinum group elements. The meltglass, which I haven’t discussed yet, and the nano diamonds are enhanced and the enhancement has been replicated on numerous occasions for each of these proxies."
[INPUT]: So anyone who says that the work of you and your team has been completely debunked is clearly not completely familiar with the literature then.
"[INPUT]: That would seem to the case. That or disingenuous in that regard. Because typically, what we see is that the opposition literature does not cite the studies that have come out. We try and cite both the critical studies and ours and give reasons why our studies supplant theirs. I wish they would share but that hasn’t been the case."
[INPUT]: Could you go to slide 82?
"[Joe Rogan]: It would be nice if we could have had you on with Mark so you guys could exchange information, but unfortunately, our capability is that we can only take one phone call at a time. We will definitely try to update that for the new studio, although we never anticipated this was going to happen in the first place, but it’s been awesome. There we go."
"[INPUT]: Up on the screen Malcolm, we’ve got from Ted Bunch et al, 2012, very high temperature impact, melt products as evidence for cosmic air bursts and impacts 12,900 years ago. We have figure from supplementary information six, the light photomicrographs of magnetic and glassy spherules from Melrose Pennsylvania, and it shows the wide variety of shapes which include spherules ovals, tear drops and dumbells, and I think… You can see pretty distinctly what you’re talking about here with the glassy spherules. I’m not sure if you were co-author of this paper or not."
[INPUT]: I was not.
[INPUT]: You were not. Okay. Are you familiar with that paper?
"[INPUT]: Yes, I am."
"[INPUT]: Good. It shows some very interesting, teardrop shapes, dumbbell shapes, you can actually see that dumbbell A chapter consists of two dis-similar accretionary spherules, one clear silicon rich and the other opaque iron rich, that have been fused together, and that’s pretty convincing evidence of the energy that’s involved in these phenomena, that you actually have these fused sperules like this.Jamie, if you go down to the next image, which is a scanning elecron microscope images, comparing Younger Dryas, boundary sperules on the top row with known impact spherules on the bottom row. This is a very interesting comparison because, and you’ve probably seen this one, Malcolm. A, there’s three across the top, three across the bottom and A is actually from Knudsens Farm in Canada.It’s cratacious tertiary boundary spherule, and just below it is a Younger Dryas spherule from Lake Cuitzeo in Mexico. One can see the morphological similarity of the two quite clearly.Then C and D compares. C is a spherule from the Tunguska air burst then D is Younger Dryas boundary from Lingen Germany, which dates to 12,800 years before present. Here you can see very clearly the rapid quench melt texture on the surface between the two, comparing Tunguska air burst with a Younger Dryas boundary object. Then finally, E and F, we have an iron-calcium-silica from Meteor Crater, compared with an iron-calcium-silica Younger Dryas boundary sperule from Abu Hureya, Syria.Again, in each of these cases, you can see the similarities between the different types of objects. You have these three objects which come from that Younger Dryas boundary layer, all which have morphological similarity to known impact proxies, and this is very difficult to dismiss this as being mere coincidence."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I would agree. Especially the A, C, B and D pictures are very similar to the material that I’m taking out of the Younger Dryas boundary at the sites that I’ve been looking at."
"[Joe Rogan]: Malcolm, what evidence, if any, are you aware of about what is that nuclear glass material called trinitite. Trinitite that’s how you say it? From what I understand, there’s quite a bit of that that also appears in the same time period, in the core samples?"
"[INPUT]: There are some instances of it, but I wouldn’t say quite a bit. Some of these, they are very site specific and one of the things I’ve been trying to do is work my way closer and closer to Canada and see if there’s any truth to this whole idea that the primary impact site was Canada. I’ve been trying to look at sites closer and closer.This would be eastern Canada. I’ve seen sites in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, that produce what appears to be some form of trinitite or meltglass, or what Ted Bunch would call scoria like objects and it seems to bear out that at least that far, we’re getting richer material out of sediment. Out of the Younger Dryas boundary sediment."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is this trinitite, this material, only produced in this manner? It’s also produced through nuclear explosion test, right? But other than that, is this the only way that it’s produced on earth?"
"[INPUT]: An impact would do it, or a fulgurite could do it."
[Joe Rogan]: What is that?
"[INPUT]: A fulgurite is what’s produced by a… A lightning strike could produce. Spherules. It could produce all the high temperature products that you see in an impact, but in a very limited way. You wouldn’t expect to see it in a layer unless there was some sort of global lightning storm.What I was going to say about the meltglass is that in the material we’re looking at, you see evidence of melted zircons, melted chromite, all of which are very high temperature features, indicating very high temperature that was experienced by that particular object."
[INPUT]: Are you seeing the image we have up here?
"[INPUT]: Yes, I am."
"[INPUT]: Great. Okay, good. There A is for Meteor Crater and B is from the Trinity Nuclear test, with a 22 kiloton yield, and then C is from one of the Soviet era nuclear tests and D is, again, a scoria like object from Abu Hureya."
[INPUT]: You’ve got to love that it says Stalinite.
"[INPUT]: The meltglass or scoria like objects has only been found in about half a dozen sites to this point. I think it’s a matter of how close you are to an impact point, and if they’re very far apart, that would lend credence to this idea of multiple impacts. If they seem to be getting more plentiful as you get further and further North, then maybe there’s more legitimacy to a primary impact site. Right now, we just don’t know. We’re still working that out."
[INPUT]: Okay. We’ve got another nice slide from the Bunch article here.
[INPUT]: Beautiful slide. That’s a god example.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, calcium oxide, rich scoria like object created by the melting of carbonate and silica rich precursor rocks, the yellow area is the calcium oxide, the white are has lechatelierite and dark areas are iron oxide. That’s a really nice —"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, lechatelierite."
"[INPUT]: I’ve been struggling with getting that pronunciation down. Then Jamie, if you go to the next one, we will see, there’s a scoria like object from Meteor Crater Arizona. You could toggle back and forth between the two so that people can kind of see the similarity between them."
"[INPUT]: In the sites that produce meltglass, that’s what I’m seeing. Those two types of particulates."
[Joe Rogan]: How much of this material are you finding in these sites?
"[INPUT]: I have to say, you don’t find a lot of this material. It’s a struggle to get it, but what you don’t find is anything above or below it, that particular layer, unless you know that there’s been a very dynamic environment, in which case, it can be spread out in the soil column."
[INPUT]: What’s the implication of nothing above it and below it?
"[INPUT]: That you’ve got a specific date for it, a specific date for it. We try to limit out investigations on layers that have been dated to the Younger Dryas boundary or contain Younger Dryas boundary layer. Like I say, if you have a very dynamic environment, it can really screw things up. It can be very difficult to interpret. If you’ve got a lot of flooding, repetitive flooding —"
[INPUT]: This is difficult science to do.
[INPUT]: Say again.
[INPUT]: This is difficult science to do.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I should add there that proving an impact is not easy. It takes a while, just as proving an impact crater is not easy, as I’m sure Mark would agree that you find a crater, there’s no guarantee there’s either an impact even or a volcanic event, until you do the research and spend the time to investigate it."
"[INPUT]: But if you could summarize for us, what’s your opinion now on the balance of the evidence, always bearing in mind that you may change that opinion as more evidence comes in?"
"[INPUT]: I would say we’re facing an unprecedented type of event here that appears to have been something approaching global. We’ve got evidence now in South America, we’ve got evidence, and a lot of this stuff is unpublished. There’s a lot of things that I could bring up that aren’t published so it’s kind of useless to refer to the, because there’s no way of checking what I’m saying, but we’re seeing stiff that goes very far into South America ad we’re seeing things in Syria. We haven’t looked elsewhere. We’ve see them out in the pacific ocean, we’ve seen it Europe, so where does it end? Right now we haven’t found an end to it yet."
[INPUT]: And it’s all at the Younger Dryas boundary?
[INPUT]: That’s correct.
[Joe Rogan]: What have you found in the Pacific Ocean?
"[INPUT]: Shermer has found… There’s a paper I can cite from his… May even be just a presentation. I can quote. He says, “We infer that the central pacific was a site of deposition of Osmium resulting from dust cloud following a meteoroid impact at 12 kiloatoms, plus or minus 4000.” Right in that ballpark, Shermer says that he found osmium, and I believe he’s come up with microspherules in that same core. The central pacific gives you an idea of how extensive this thing was."
"[Joe Rogan]: Malcolm, this is obviously some controversial material. It’s fairly new in terms of the public consciousness. Have you had anybody debate you on this or have you had anybody oppose you?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. It goes with the territory. In some respects, in some cases, I wish the opposition was of a bit higher caliber than what I’ve seen. I think it’s been a sad state that the most viral in opposition, I haven’t regarded as particularly high quality."
"[INPUT]: Malcolm, Michael Shermer here. Do you have an opinion on the association of the impact with the megafauna extinction, and also then Graham’s hypothesis about the extinction of this lost civilization?"
"[INPUT]: I won’t even comment on the lost civilization aspects of this. I have a hard enough time dealing with the meteoroid impact. As far as the megafauna goes, I guess I would say all of the above. I think that all these factors came into play. You’ve got humans who are, for that period, technologically advanced with the Clovers point and the atlatl and the spear, the replaceable spear tip that must have been devastating to the fauna, but the idea of attacking a proboscidean to me, is almost unthinkable.Today, if you don’t have a high powered riffle, I just don’t see how you realistically go up against a bull elephant. It just strikes me as far too dangerous to take on, but there are aspect of that question that I think are going to be very interestingly debated in the next couple of years or so.We have a book coming out that addresses that directly at one of the sites I’ve been researching, that the whole extinction of the megafauna may have been as much related to religion as something else. There may have been a religion built around the extinction of the megafauna."
[Joe Rogan]: How so?
[INPUT]: You’d want the evidence for that and that evidence will be coming out in a book that’s going to be published in about a month or two.
"[Joe Rogan]: I could speak to the whole idea of hunting bull elephants though unfortunately. People have been hunting them with bows and arrows forever. It’s not an atlatl is less effective. You get range, but people hunt with not just modern compound bows, which are very powerful, which would allow you to shoot from 100 yards away, but with long bows, they’ve been hunting elephants with bows and arrows for a long time.Especially the thing with woolly mammoths was that that they would go after the females apparently, according to Dan Flores who wrote American Serengeti, and that the females would keep the young in their body.Their gestation period was very long. I believe you said it was two years. Is that correct? I think you said it was two years, so it made them extremely vulnerable. When they were pregnant, obviously if you kill off the females that are pregnant, you’re killing off a substantial part of the breeding population and the population suffers tremendously.But it also could have been that end. Humans I’m sure had an impact on virtually anything that we could eat when we’re starving, but whether or not we wipe them out, the blitzkrieg hypothesis, there’s a lot of hole in that theory according to a lot of people that have studied it."
"[INPUT]: I think if you have an environmental impact or a degradation of the environment that might follow a significant extra-terrestrial impact, you’re reducing the population or stressing the population of megafauna that way, and then you’ve got a population of hunters in addition to that, especially if they’re, for some reason or other, focused on hunting proboscideans, and when the number gets limited, they don’t care whether it’s a female or male, and they go after whatever they can get, then I think the population of megafauna is going to suffer. I think it’s a combination of factors, not necessarily just one."
"[Joe Rogan]: I think that’s very reasonable. Malcolm, is there anything else you would like to add before we let you go?Malcolm; No. I guess one thing is I found it interesting the discussion of the scab-lands and that was really… It was looking at the scab-lands from flying over them when I was a young naval officer, that got me interested in science and why I pursued science. It was looking at the catastrophes that were etched in the landscape there, the catastrophic floods that really caused me to pursue a career in science. It’s really a remarkable landscape. It’s just a personal observation."
"[Joe Rogan]: We’re very thankful for your time and we really appreciate your input here. It means a lot. Thank you for everything you’ve done. Thank you for everything that you continue to do to highlight this. it is such a fascinating subject and it’s so amazing and without someone like you present hard data and science, it would definitely be lost, so thank you. Thank you so much."
[INPUT]: Thank you. Thank you Malcolm.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, thank you Malcolm."
[INPUT]: my pleasure.
[Joe Rogan]: All right Malcolm. We’re going to let you go.
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: Take it easy buddy. Sound down.
[INPUT]: Time for your nap Malcolm.
"[Joe Rogan]: It’s a lot of energy. These podcasts are long. Four hours the guy was sitting there on standby, probably chomping at the bit. Jamie, before we go, I want to see some pictures of the scab-lands, because that is pretty amazing stuff. Randall, one more thing before we go, one thing that you pointed out to me during one of the episodes that was so stunning was these woolly mammoths that had been literally knocked over by an impact, with broken legs and they dies on the spot. Do you have those images?"
[INPUT]: I do. That was actually a mastodon.
"[Joe Rogan]: Mastodon. I’m sorry. I want to see those. Let’s go the scab-lands first so we can show the audience on Youtube, which is by the way, only about 10% of the people that watch this, so if you’re listening to this, go check out the scab-lands on Google. Describe it to us Randall."
"[INPUT]: This is textbook scab-land right here. Let’s see. This is probably Rock Lake or Sprague Lake in the [Chany Pulus 03Going down there, that’s Palouse Falls. That’s an underfit waterfall because what you have to realize is that at the peak of the flooding, this entire scene was submerged below water, and the cataract here is an extinct feature. The flow over here was thousands of times greater than the present Palouse River that you see right there. We’ve got a lot of great pictures up on the Geocosmic Rex website and some awesome video clips."
[Joe Rogan]: Explain it.
"[INPUT]: Geocosmic Rex, R-E-X."
"[Joe Rogan]: Rex, okay. I thought you were saying wreck, like car wreck."
[INPUT]: It’s a play on words. We are talking about that. We’ve got some great drone footage on there. Did we show that last time I was here?
[Joe Rogan]: I don’t believe we did.
[INPUT]: We might have. I think you showed a bit of the camas prairie ripples.
"[INPUT]: Did we show potholes, cataract? This whole scab-land thing has literally fascinated me since 1970. like Malcolm, I think that summer of 1970, traveling out in some of these landscapes was —"
[Joe Rogan]: There we go.
[INPUT]: Here we go.
[Joe Rogan]: This is the drone footage. Wow. It’s incredible.
"[INPUT]: Let’s see. Be ready to pause is we need to here. Is this the beginning, because at the beginning, we have a Google Earth image so you can get a sense of what we’re looking at here. Go back the beginning. Right at the very beginning."
[INPUT]: It starts off with the drone going up.
[INPUT]: It starts off with the drone. Okay. There should be another one that actually —
[Joe Rogan]: That’s okay. This is pretty cool.
"[INPUT]: These are 400 foot cliffs. This was a recessional cataract, very similar to dry falls. The water was coming from behind our view here."
"[Joe Rogan]: Where is this specifically, if anybody wanted to go watch this or look at this area?"
"[INPUT]: Oh, the actual area?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: This is in Eastern Washington.
[Joe Rogan]: Where specifically?
"[INPUT]: This is on the eastern rim of Quincy Basin, it’s called. If you can see up there where those cliffs are, in the middle distance, right below there is the Columbia River. This is just North of Wenatchee, Washington. Basically what we had here was plucking.Quarrying as the water poured over this ridge. This is the Badcock ridge and behind, this is the Quincy Basin, which served a temporary holding pond. As the drone comes around, I’m looking for the team. Keep going. Zoom in a little bit more there Jamie."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I think we did show this. We can see you guys down there on the ground, right?"
[INPUT]: Yeah. We’re in there somewhere lost in the vastness of the —
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Now I remember we did show this. What about those images of the masodons? Let’s look at those and then let’s get out of here.
"[INPUT]: Okay. For that, you have to go to The World of the Plasticine, which I just should have given you."
[Joe Rogan]: That sounds like an amusement park. The World of the Plasticine. You go there and it’s some dudes with animal skins and pointed sticks.
"[INPUT]: Maybe if they succeed in cloning some of those frozen animals up there, maybe —"
"[Joe Rogan]: They’re really talking about doing that, right?"
[INPUT]: Yeah. I don’t know how plausible it is but hey.
[Joe Rogan]: That seems like a terrible idea. The Lost World of the Plasticine.
[INPUT]: What could go wrong?
"[Joe Rogan]: Nothing. It’s not like there’s any diseases. That’s one of the big concerns about climate change, right? That we’re going to release some diseases that we don’t have an immune system for."
[INPUT]: Go to slide 78. This is good example of —
"[Joe Rogan]: By the way, who was more thoroughly documented than Randall Carlson. Jesus Christ. Go to slide 6,222."
[INPUT]: 50 plus years of walking the walk in the channel scab-lands.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. This is a bone deposit. What happens is that in the particularly warm eras when the permafrost around the rivers collapses, it exposes these huge deposits of bones, which have been buried in the permafrost. When I look at stuff like this, this is why I say there had to be another mechanisms of extinction besides human hunting."
[Joe Rogan]: Because of this pile?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: This is not necessarily at the bottom of a cliff, right? Because you know that they pushed a lot of them off cliffs and they —"
"[INPUT]: No. This is stuff that when the river floods, it erodes the banks and then this stuff falls out of the river banks. It’s been locked into the permafrost for however many thousands of years of years, and it seems like there’s interestingly two peaks of dates that one, right around 13,000 and the other one around 36,000, that the fossilized remains are dating to."
"[Joe Rogan]: Which could point to potentially that there was some sort of an impact back then as well, or something else?"
[INPUT]: Who knows? I don’t know. I don’t have an opinion on that.
"[Joe Rogan]: But by having all these together, has it been theorized that perhaps this was… There’s not a cliff near this, right?"
[INPUT]: Just off to the right.
[Joe Rogan]: There is a cliff?
"[INPUT]: There is a cliff. We’re at the bottom of a cliff right here. Actually, it’s a riverbank."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you know that that was a hunting method? They used to storm them off the side of cliffs, and they never… They literally couldn’t even eat all of them."
"[INPUT]: Like head smashed in, buffalo head smashed in."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: They would run so many of them off cliffs.
"[INPUT]: But here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. When you look at these mortality events of modern animals, even looking at elephants that perished during some of the severe droughts in the 80s in Africa, taphonomic studies show that it doesn’t take three, four, five years before the remains have completely disappeared.I order to preserve a fossil, it has to be rapidly removed from any kind of forces, oxidation or scavengers or anything that would consume it. This stuff, again, it’s been frozen in the permafrost for however many years. 10 or 12 or 15,000 years."
[Joe Rogan]: So it’s likely covered in an event.
"[INPUT]: Covered in an event, yes."
[Joe Rogan]: There was one that I really wanted you to get to that was a mastodon that has been literally knocked over and had broken legs.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. We could look very quickly at slide 92. This is one of the more interesting anomalous events. This was the flash frozen woolly mammoth. Go to slide 93. It’s a much clearer. This was a mammoth, six-tonne mammoth that was, again, one of these river collapses.The banks collapsed during a warm spring and exposed this remains of a woolly mammoth, with soft-tissue preserved, contents of the food in its stomach undigested. Actually, a mouthful of food. The hips of the mammoth were both broken, as if he was thrown back on his hunches very violently. He had an erect penis, which suggests that he was suffocated."
[Joe Rogan]: Or he was a freak.
"[INPUT]: Or he was freak. He was getting ready to… Michael laughs at that. The wolves ate the flesh off the skull, that’s why it’s buried like that. You’ll see the front left forelimb there, you see the bottom there. Right at the center of the screen, that’s his back leg that you see right there. The interesting this about this is the repetitive climate change that’s implied by being able to freeze a six-tonne mammoth, because the contents of his stomach, according to the studies, had not really been putrefied yet, which implies that the entire carcass had been frozen through and through, probably in less than ten hours."
[INPUT]: Like Otzi the ice man. That’s what happened to him.
"[INPUT]: That’s exactly what happened to him, yes. Interesting point. That would be a subject that we should talk about."
"[Joe Rogan]: He fell in between in between a crevice and glacier, correct?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, and probably got rapidly buried under the snow and the ice, and that’s how he ended. Yeah, overnight. Exactly. The next slide actually shows a reconstruction in a museum in Russia, showing what the mammoth… The circumstances under which he was found. If you go to —"
"[INPUT]: By the way, as a side bar on Otzi, to show you how science changes rather slowly sometimes, it was decade before they found out he was murdered, because they arrow point in his scapula here that cut his bone, and he had defensive wounds on his hands and arms, so he’d gotten in a fight, and he had other people’s bloods on his hand, so he gave as good as he got and lost a fight, so he was murdered.It was all that careful observation in laboratories, 10 years before that came out. Sometimes this stuff has to just take a while. If can try to find some common ground, before we sign off, with Graham, your book, you have this really great sentence that I quote, “It would mean at least that some unknown, unidentified people somewhere in the world, had already mastered all the arts and attributes of a high civilization more than 12,000 years ago, and sent out emissaries around the world.”I think that’s as an entirely possible cognitively, for sure. What would do it for me, the boats that the sent the emissaries out on, the wood, carbon 14 dated and some specific examples of arts and attributes of high civilization. If it’s not metal and writing, whatever it is, would change my mind. Absolutely."
"[INPUT]: That’s good to hear, Michael. I think as the research continues in this area, for the last few years, having been very much an outsider, I have felt that the evidence is moving in a direction that is helpful to the argument that I make.I hope it will continue to be that way. I hope the evidence that you’re looking for will come out. Like I say, my role is a reporter and I’m trying to be a reporter for the alternative sides of things, but to do so in an effective and hopefully thoroughly enough as well."
"[INPUT]: There’s a good argument in the history of science, to be made for the role of outsiders. Complete outsiders, to come in and shake things up. [Freeman Daison 03Absolutely. If nothing else, they push people to really figure out what it is they believe and why, because otherwise, no one’s going to challenge them."
[INPUT]: [Allen Brandz 03
[Joe Rogan]: How about Randall Carlson? He’s a good example of that too.
[INPUT]: We’ll see. Do you still want to look at this real quick? The mastodon. I’ve got it right here.
"[Joe Rogan]: Absolutely. Let’s do it. He can go for days. That’s what I love about Randall. He never gets tired of this stuff. If you could bottle your enthusiasm, it could be an awesome pill."
[INPUT]: Maybe we could talk about that.
[INPUT]: Put it in the memory focus there.
[INPUT]: We’re going to look at this mastodon here.
[INPUT]: You said 125?
"[INPUT]: 125, yeah. This is a mastodon that was dug up in a pit years ago. Excavation showed that the bones were lying on and in a layer of limey clay or mural, about one foot in thickness. When it gets up there and it goes on to say the skeleton proved to be badly disturbed and the bones crushed and broken, as an example of the amount of the disturbance.One of the ribs lay beneath one of the tusks, while another was thrust through an aperture in the pelvis. A shoulder blade rested to the right of the skull and one of the large neck vertebrae was found about ten feet from the skull, near a portion of the pelvis. In spite of the wide dislocation of the parts, now this is where it really is interesting, the bones of one of the feet remained intact and in place, very possibly, in the spot where the animal last stepped.In other words, there was a foot still embedded in the soft material where he was apparently stepping at the time whatever happened to him."
[Joe Rogan]: This is all the same time period as the other mastodon?
"[INPUT]: We don’t have dating on this, but it likely was at the very end, probably right in the Younger Dryas window because of the amount of sediment over it. Go to the next slide Jamie and we’ll see 126. We can get a better view."
"[Joe Rogan]: This thing, theoretically at least, was blown back?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. There we go. There we can see one of the femurs that’s been busted squarely across. They go on to say that even the largest of the bones such as the thigh bones, were broken squarely across in places indicating that some considerable force had been exerted upon them. Any conclusion as to an agency powerful enough to cause such destruction must be highly speculative.Basically what you’re seeing here is mastodon that got smashed into the ground. The force is… There were strong powerful sheer forces that would have literally separated his leg from the foot that’s still immersed into the ground. There are many examples of this. The last slide we’re going to show. If you go back… I promise."
"[INPUT]: I once went digging with Jack Honer, the paleontologist, the dinosaur digger, and he showed this debrief flow pile ups of dinosaur bones that had been splintered and broken, and these are huge. Just from the force of the water, and then piling up of a wall. If it can do it to a dinosaur."
"[INPUT]: 85. 85 is an interesting slide because what it shows is the London Ivory docks, which over a period of about two centuries. This was a mammoth ivory that’s being dug out of the Siberian permafrost —"
[Joe Rogan]: That’s just a drawing.
"[INPUT]: That’s just a drawing, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: That’s the problem with that. Like that’s what it looked like.
[INPUT]: This is what it looked like.
[Joe Rogan]: Are you sure bro?
"[INPUT]: A 19th century scene showing the ivory floor of the London docks, covered by thousands of mammoth tusks, and this went on year after year, after year, after year for roughly two centuries."
"[Joe Rogan]: There is so much of that mammoth ivory, by the way, that they use it to make knife handles. I actually have a knife handle that was made out of mammoth ivory. It’s still to this day, not only is it legal, but it’s common to use mammoth ivory for different kinds of things. There’s so much of it."
[INPUT]: They’re not an endangered species because they’re…
[Joe Rogan]: It’s kind of a loophole.
"[INPUT]: In this case though, what we have is tusks that are being dug out of the permafrost. How did they get there? That becomes the question. Does it have anything to do with human predation or was it a natural catastrophe that somehow ended up putting all these mammoths down and burying them in the permafrost? That’s the question I want to raise."
"[INPUT]: I think we raised a lot of questions. I think we got some pretty good answers. I think we had some great dialogue and I really appreciate your time, all three of you guys. Thank you to Malcolm and thank you to Mark. Thank you to young Jamie."
[INPUT]: Thanks for hosting us.
[INPUT]: Thank you to you Joe.
[Joe Rogan]: My pleasure. It was a treat.
[INPUT]: Can I do a quick shout out?
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: I want to thank Brad Young, Cameron Wiltshire, my brother Roan, my wife Julie for helping make this possible. I also want to have people go to the Geocosmic Rex website and the Sacrogeometry International website for a lot more of this kind of stuff."
"[INPUT]: I’m going to thank my beloved partner and wife, Santha, who’s shared every adventure with me for the last quarter of a century. We’ve climbed the great pyramid together, we’ve been at the bottom of the ocean together and I wouldn’t be doing any of this stuff if it weren’t for that wonderful woman behind me."
"[Joe Rogan]: Michael Shermer, who do you want to thank?"
"[INPUT]: I thank my wife Jennifer, my little boy Vinnie and my agent… No, but skeptic.com and my partner Pat who keeps the show running when I’m running around doing things like these."
"[INPUT]: And Joe Rogan. Let’s thank Joe Rogan, because I can tell you this Joe, I speak all over the world and whether it’s South Africa, or whether it’s Japan, or whether it’s Britain, or whether it’s United States or whether it’s Croatia, people come up to me and they say, “Joe Rogan sent me.”"
[Joe Rogan]: Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate everybody who’s listening.
[INPUT]: You have the most interesting guests.
"[Joe Rogan]: You’re one of them dude. All you guys are. Thank you so much. We’ll see you guys soon. Thank you. Bye.[INPUT]: Be honest, Dana made you start wearing those suits didn't he?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes. They're kinda gross and make me feel like a fancy man, but the UFC likes when I wear them and now I no longer have to pack my standard black button down dress shirt in my luggage so I agreed to it."
"I'm not a suit guy, but the tailor that makes those things is amazing. He expertly figured out how to get fancy clothes to look fairly reasonable on my troll like body. I'm just not the kind of person to focus on fancy clothes normally. I'm not ruling out change, though. Who the fuck knows, I might wake up one day and decide to wear suits for the rest of my life. I leave everything open."
[INPUT]: What advice would you give a younger you?
"[Joe Rogan]: I probably wouldn't tell me shit. I would probably say, ""Good luck, bitch!"" One of the most fascinating lessons I've absorbed about life is that the struggle is good. You can't know tomorrow, because if you did you would never go about trying to create it the same way. The uncertainty and doubt that fuck with our minds are the same forces that make accomplishments and achievements so fucking amazing when you pull them off. It's almost like life has to suck sometimes to appreciate what's cool."
"My 20 year old self would have to figure out all this shit the hard way, just like I did. Just like I'm still doing today. If I could go forward in time to when I'm 90 I would probably give the me of today the same advice. ""Good luck, bitch!"""
"The struggle is real, and there are many ways you can benefit from it."
[INPUT]: How delighted are you by the Stanhope surge in the last few years?
"Over due, or long over due?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Perfect. Not too soon, not too late. Stanhope is a national treasure and a voice of reason and humor that in a sane society would be heralded as a prophet. He's proof that alcohol when consumed wisely can have great consciousness managing benefits. He's proof there are no rules. He's one of the greatest comics ever, and I love the shit out of him."
"[INPUT]: Joe, I'm a big fan of your podcasts - after the recent excellent five hour podcast from Ari Shaffir do you think that having any sort of podcast time limit should be transcended and ultimately you will just provide a live 24 hr feed of everything you say, do, and think?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I have a strange feeling that something similar is what the future holds for all of us. Every person will be a channel, and we'll be able to tune into each other's lives the way we tune into shows today. We'll eventually be able to actually experience all the sensations people are feeling as well. First just physically, then eventually the actual emotions and even the thought processes. I think about this shit all the time, and as the interconnectedness that we experience from technology continues to expand I feel like it's just a matter of time before something like this is a reality. Or maybe I'm just really high. Or both."
[INPUT]: My son is 5 years old.Is that a good age to get him into martial arts or should i wait a bit?
"[Joe Rogan]: I think as long as he's interested it's a fine time if you find a really good instructor. Don't take him to the first place you can find, look around and do as much research as you can. mixedmartialarts.com is an amazing resourse for finding out about schools near you. I think for little kids one consideration is to not push them and make sure they're having fun. He's just a little boy, and as long as he's enjoying it he's going to grow, but I always worry with kids that age that if you push them into something it can deter their enthusiasm for it for a long time."
"Another thing that can be of benefit to young kids is learning traditional martial arts. I wouldn't recommend many forms of traditional martial arts as a primary skillset for someone that's an adult that wants to fight soon, but for little kids the discipline and philosophy you get from a really good traditional school can really come in handy in life. There's lots of lessons that people learn inherently from pushing themselves in hard training, but I think one of the things that many folks that only participate in MMA training miss is the tools that really solid traditional martial arts styles teach for managing the mind."
There's also a benefit in taking traditional styles early (like Tae Kwon Do) because you develop flexibility and kicking dexterity before your body matures. To this day I'm really flexible and I have to think that a lot of that can be attributed to starting Tae Kwon Do and stretching right when I was going through puberty.
"[INPUT]: What is your take on the recent Elon Musk comments claiming that the current progress in artificial intelligence development is ""summoning the demon""?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Elon Musk is a real visionary, and when he says shit like this I certainly don't take it lightly. I think that the inevitability of artificial intelligence reaching some sort of unimaginable level of awareness is something that a lot of people avoid thinking about. Even really intelligent people. It's almost like looking at death. It makes us uncomfortable so we just avoid it."
"It could also be that we're just wrapped up in the standard bullshit of every day life so much that we're not giving the concept of artificial life and the potential problems that it can create the attention that it deserves. Almost like a test that we know we're going to have to study for, but beginning that studying is just too painful so we continually put it off."
"If you sit alone and ponder it, charting out possible courses of progression from what they're working on now and imagine what the possibilities could hold 50, 100 or 1000 years from now I could easily imagine a scenario where artificial intelligence becomes the dominant ""life"" form on this planet. Scary shit for us."
[INPUT]: When they finally perfect the robot Fuck doll what will you name yours ?
"[Joe Rogan]: Hitler. I always wanted to fuck someone named Hitler. After I was done I would change her name to something more beautiful, I would just call her Hitler for the first one to check that off the list."
"[INPUT]: Hey Joe, I love your comedy. Do you ever get jealous of another comedian and say to yourself ""damn, I wish I wrote that""?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't anymore, but I definitely did when I was young. I recognized that as a bit of a mental trap and considered it a weakness so I flushed it out of my psyche. I think a lot of how we move around in this life is based on habit, and not having a well thought out philosophy for dealing with common traps the mind and ego can set for you. I realized a long time ago that instead of being jealous you can be inspired and appreciative. It carries more energy to you, with none of the mental weight that comes from knowing that you're being a weak bitch. When you're jealous, especially of someone else's art or creations you automatically put up these selfish walls that reinforce your stupid ideas. It's hard to pull those walls down and look at what you're hiding. Look at your own weakness and realize that the jealousy came from knowing that you're intimidated by someone else's work, and that when you compare it to your own, you fall short."
"That can be an awesome motivating force that can improve your life if you choose to be inspired and not jealous. One (being jealous) has no benefit whatsoever, the other is an incredible resource for creating momentum and improvement. The choice seems like it would be easy, but for whatever fucked up reason our primitive monkey brains gravitate towards jealousy first. Fortunately with the proper attention and focus we can re-wire those shitty, useless thoughts and use the same events to inspire us to grow and improve."
"Don't hate, appreciate."
[INPUT]: Joe! How was your first day back at the Store?
"[Joe Rogan]: It was awesome. That place has a special energy that I really missed in the 7 years of not performing there. The new crop of young comics that are working there are completely on another level too. Much better in pretty much every way than past generation graduating classes. They're more original, more inspired, more intelligent, etc. I'm really happy I decided to come back. That place has me really fired up."
"[INPUT]: If your comedy and podcast career came to a sudden end, what would you feel was your biggest accomplishment?"
"[Joe Rogan]: There's some things I'm happy about from my comedy career, and I'm really happy that I've been able to make people laugh and distract them from their day to day bullshit at a comedy show or because they enjoyed one of my CDs or TV specials, but I don't know how many people have actually had life changing thoughts because of it. The podcast on the other hand has spawned so many intense conversations with so many brilliant people that have shared so many amazing thoughts that it's actually enhanced people's lives. I never saw that coming. I can't count how many people have come up to me and told me that certain conversations have permanently altered the way they look at life for the better, and have inspired them to improve their lives."
"To me, that's probably the biggest accomplishment. None of it was by design, all of it was pretty unexpected, and it's something I value and appreciate deeply. That fucking podcast has some sort of weird life of its own. Sometimes I feel like I have this weird responsibility to show up and feed it, and that's really all I do. I go in, and turn everything on and feed this thing that has its own objectives. It's certainly shaped my life in a pretty profound way as well. Having the privilege of sitting down and having 3 hour long uninterrupted conversations with hundreds of brilliant people is an awesome perspective enhancer."
"[INPUT]: Of all the mind-blowing things you and Duncan discuss about life, what core value/main point do you believe most likely to be true?"
"[Joe Rogan]: At the end of the day when Duncan and I sit down and have these podcasts it's just two comics trying to make sense of shit and bouncing ideas of each other and out to you folks. I try to emphasise things that I've found to be true in my own life, and things that have resonated with me, and Duncan does the same, but we're really just two stoned comedians shooting the shit."
"All of us, you folks included, everyone that is really pondering the mysteries of life - we're all doing the same shit. We're thinking, pondering, dissecting - and hopefully extracting something out of these conversations that we can hold onto, like some sort of a psychic shield protecting you from worthless thoughts. Duncan and I are doing it on a podcast, but I see it all over the net in the form of facebook conversations, twitter debates, and of course other people's podcasts. I think it's why we value honesty so much and are disgusted by deception. We're thinking. Some of it sounds like stoner-bro horseshit (and rightly so) some of it is hilarious, and some of it occasionally misses the mark and veers off into the vast wasteland of retarded ideas."
"I think what it does for us, and hopefully for you folks too is entertain and stimulate. I know when Duncan and I have these marathon THC fueled conversations I've come away from many of them with a huge smile on my face, an awesome appreciation of how fucking cool and smart Duncan is, and a constantly renewed appreciation of how fun it is to talk to him in a podcast form that I know other people are going to appreciate as well."
[INPUT]: I loved when you had Neil Tyson on your show. Any chance you will have him on again?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, we almost did another one recently, but it was real last minute and the only time he had available I was out of town. We'll make it happen again hopefully. I think Neil is one of the most important cultural figures in regards to spreading the fascination of science that our civilization has ever known. It's an honor to call that guy a friend."
[INPUT]: Do you feel that your message is lost on your stand-up and people see it as just humor? Or do you think people understand the message that you try to send with it?
"[Joe Rogan]: I think one of the best things that's ever happened to my stand up is the podcast because now I no longer have any motivation to send a ""message"" in a joke form. I just want my shit to be funny. If I can make points and be funny at the same time, awesome. I'm all for it, but most importantly it has to be interesting and funny to me. I can explore ideas until the end of time on the podcast and never need it to be funny, but for me as a fan at least, the comedy that I truly enjoy is the comedy that makes me laugh the most. In the past comics didn't have something like a podcast where they could go into great depth about a fuck load of different subjects, so to get their ideas across and express themselves they had to do it in their act. That led to a lot of comics getting ""preachy"" onstage, something that most people think is pretty gross."
"The beautiful thing about podcasting is it's just talking. It can be funny, or it can be terrifying. It can be sweet. It can be obnoxious. It almost has no definitive form. In that sense it's one of the best ways to explore an idea, and certainly much less limiting than trying to express the same idea in stand up comedy. For some ideas stand up is best, but it's really, really nice to have podcasts as well."
[INPUT]: Which UFC fighters do you enjoy watching the most right now? How do you think Jon Jones would do at heavyweight?
"[Joe Rogan]: I can honestly say that we've reached such an amazing level of talent in the UFC across the board that there's no one fighter that I can say I enjoy the most. I love watching Jon Jones fight, but I also love watching TJ Dillashaw. I love watching Mighty Mouse. I love watching Luke Rockhold, I love watching Hector Lombard, I love watching Rory MacDonald - I can go on and on and probably list hundreds of fighters both in the UFC and in other organizations that I really get fired up to watch."
"I'm really excited about Cub Swanson and Frankie Edgar this weekend. That's an intense, high stakes, high level match up between two guys that are absolutely on a championship level. I'm beyond pumped for this match up. To me, this fight should be a national sporting event. I think that's just more evidence that MMA in the USA has room to grow. For the hard core fans that's a real dream fight, as was Cub Swanson VS Jeremy Stephens. The more people realize how incredibly proficient these guys are at MMA the more people are going to appreciate the what a treat it is to get to witness a fight like that take place live."
We live in amazing times when it comes to the level of martial arts athletes. There's really never been anything like it in all of recorded history.
[INPUT]: Should Andy Dick be incarcerated?
"[Joe Rogan]: Andy is a good guy. Even when he's out of control he's not hurting people. I would love to see him get his life together. He's a really funny, talented dude. Working with him was difficult sometimes because I would keep breaking up while we were doing a scene. There were several scenes we did together that I just couldn't stop laughing while we were filming them."
"[INPUT]: I noticed a striking similarity between ""Conspiracy Theory"" with The Body and ""Joe Rogan Questions Everything""...were you a fan of Ventura's show and did it influence your show?"
"[Joe Rogan]: The same people produced it. I wanted to avoid that ""style"" of dealing with those subjects as much as possible, but we failed in a lot of ways. There are a lot of people involved in making a show like that, and a lot of them have ways of editing and producing shit with sound effects and cliff hanger B.S. that they just do automatically. It took a while to work that out. We got away from it altogether by the end of the episodes. We're talking about doing more of those shows, but it would have to be totally different."
"The problem with a lot of the subjects that we covered was that I went into them with an open mind, but along the way you discover that most of it is just plain bullshit. It's not just bullshit, it's bullshit with an industry attached to it. People that make their living talking about this bullshit, and you see them in many shows that are made on the same subject. I thought that we could do something that approached the entire platform with an open mind, but ultimately when you go looking at UFOs or bigfoot or what-have-you, there's just nothing there."
"If we do it again it will be more based on actual real things that can be verified, like the episodes we did on transhumanism and pandemic diseases."
"[INPUT]: I'm a big fan of your kale shake recipe. I actually use it with my juicer tho, but it makes some delicious juice. Yeah, yeah, I know, fiber and whatnot, but some of us can't afford a fucking expensive blender; tried making a kale shake in my cheap-ass Ninja but it ended up more like kale applesauce which was... unpleasant to consume. Anyway, have you got any other favorite shake/juice recipes that you could share with us?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Juice is fine, and it's definitely better than no juice! I think the whole plant with the fiber is more nutritious, but again, better than no juice. Those kale shakes aren't fun. They're fucking gross."
"They do make you feel fantastic, though. I drink one with lots of garlic and ginger and although I'm sure with 4 cloves of garlic I probably smell like shit it really gives me a charge. Almost like a stimulant."
"It's important to mix it up and not to over do it, though. I've heard of a few stories on the internet of people juicing every single meal for long stretches and you can get sick, especially if you eat the same vegetables in large doses over and over again. Mixing up the ingredients seems like a wise idea."
"Obviously it should go without saying, but it's important to mention that I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I read the things that scientists have figured out, and apply what they say is beneficial, but at the end of the day I'm the wrong person to get unchallenged nutritional advice from. I'm just too ignorant of the actual mechanisms at work. I can have a conversation with someone like Dr. Rhonda Patrick and apply what she recommends, but the reality is we should all be asking these questions to people like her, not me."
"[INPUT]: One of those float spa/sensory deprivation chamber places opened up near me and I'm thinking of checking it out. I've enjoyed meditation before and explored some awesome places in my mind, so trying out those tanks seems interesting. They've got a first time special and I could get a great price on a two hour session; think that'd be too long for a first timer? Any advice for a first timer or any cool experiences/trips/insights into the nature of the universe you'd like to share from the experience in a sensory deprivation tank?"
"[Joe Rogan]: As for the tank, 2 hours is great. Better than signing up for 1, because you might just be settling down and relaxing at 1 hour and you might wish you had more time in there once your mind has gotten ""still."" The best thing about the tank is it's perception enhancing effects. The fact that it gives you a way to look at life with the least amount of distractions possible. For me, it's been an amazing resource. All the psychedelic experiences aside, it's fantastic for just chilling out and floating. Plus it makes your body feel amazing."
[INPUT]: I enjoy your more critical interviews like the one with Peter Schiff or Steven Greer where you really try to nail down what their views are and why they are so controversial.
"Your shows often have a lot of strawman arguments with creationists, feminists, whatever and sometimes I feel stupid listening to two skeptics circle-jerk about why creationists are dumb or two dudes talking about feminism. Do you think you could just have someone you disagree with on the show and get to the bottom of it?"
"[Joe Rogan]: That's a fair point. There's a lot of people that I disagree with that I think I could have interesting conversations with. What I don't want to get into is manufactured conflict. I would much rather talk to someone like Dr. Rhonda Patrick or Randall Carlson and be mesmerized by information. I guess in a way that's selfish, or maybe not objective of me. The older (and hopefully wiser) I get the less interested I am in conflict. I don't mind disagreeing with people in a civil way, but I definitely don't want to go out of my way to have an argument unless it's a really important subject."
[INPUT]: How do you stay so inspired/committed/driven?
"[Joe Rogan]: I'm just really fucking lucky that I've found a bunch of things that are really interesting to me. Creating comedy, podcasting, MMA - all those things are really compelling and exciting for me so enthusiasm comes naturally. Inspiration is everywhere, especially when you're looking for it specifically. There's just so many cool people out there doing so much cool shit that you almost have to go out of your way to not be inspired."
"[INPUT]: My son was born two weeks ago...what are the main lessons you have about parenting? In your mind, what are the most important things to teach my son?"
"[Joe Rogan]: As for your son, congratulations! There's so much advice you could get, and so many things you're probably going to figure out about yourself while you're raising him that I really don't know where to start. One thing that has helped me is to try to think as objectively as possibly when you're teaching them things or correcting them. One thing I ALWAYS do when I correct my kids is to let them know I did the exact same things they did. We all make mistakes, and that's how you learn and grow. I try to be as vulnerable in that regard as I can. I also tell them that I love them as much as life itself and that my goal in explaining something or correcting them is just to make them grow and develop into the happiest, best person they can be. Even though I'm not sure how much of that gets in at 3 or 4, I think if you keep explaining things that way eventually it becomes a standard idea in their little minds. I hope that helps!"
"[INPUT]: Hey Joe, what's your take on the feminists attacking Dr. Matt Taylor for his shirt?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I think if they were communicating with him in person it would have been an entirely different experience for everyone involved. Writing blogs on the internet is an amazing way to express yourself and to distribute information, but it's not the best place to discuss ideas with an individual that you have an issue with. If the people that wrote blogs shitting on him for wearing that shirt just talked to him, I'm pretty sure the reaction wouldn't have been nearly as extreme."
"What I find really interesting about it is trying to look at it from the varying female standpoint. Why did some women hate that shirt, and why did some defend it? What is the differences in the mind sets of each group and which side if any has more merit?"
"I'm not a woman, but I'm pretty sure that if I was there would be a lot of shit that I would be annoyed with that doesn't bother me as a man. Especially when it pertains to sexualized perceptions of women in an arena (science) where many women are struggling to fit in. I don't know. I try to look at conflicts like this from as many different angles as is humanly possible, and in a lot of ways there is no one answer. What's offensive to one woman is cool as fuck and appreciated by another. Neither one is wrong, really. I think that's where the whole idea of ""professional"" behavior and dress comes from; wearing fairly uniform clothes like suits and ties and behaving in a uniform way with no sexual remarks or off color humor to mitigate potential disagreements over what's acceptable."
"Of course the problem with that, is that takes a lot of the fun out of working at a place. If you work at a cool place and the people you work with are funny and kind and they say fucked up hilarious shit to you on occasion, that makes working there even more awesome. I've had many a job that on the surface should have sucked balls, but I have awesome memories of working there because the people I worked with were fun. It's certainly a tricky situation."
I do think it's unfortunate that so much energy was spent concentrating on his shirt instead of the incredible accomplishment of landing a robot on a comet. It's just another example of how we're figuring this shit out as we go along. A bizarre footnote in the evolution of the culture of one of the strangest creatures we've ever observed; people.
"[INPUT]: Hey Joe, huge fan here. I started working at Cap City Comedy Club in Austin after hearing how much you loved the club on your podcast which leads me to my question. What is your favorite club in 'Murica to perform at? And given the choice, who is your favorite comic to bring on the road with you and why?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't really have one ""favorite"" club. Cap City is most certainly amongst my list of favorites, though. As for one comic, it would be Joey Diaz. No one consistently makes me laugh the way he does, and he just makes everything else around him funny. We always say that Joey ""brings the party."" That's really the best way to describe him. I fucking love that dude."
"[INPUT]: I am a passionate, solo musician/producer, and I look up to you for creating your own brand and a name for yourself. Do you have any advice for a solo musician/producer (I make my own music, play all the instruments and produce it, check out relicradiation.com), advice for how to get your name to the proper people who can help me get my name out there? Do I need to spend money to get myself out there or should I do both the old school ways of promotion combined with the internet and spend some money?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't know much about the music business, but for just general advice for someone trying to create things, as simple as this sounds, I think the best thing you can do is constantly try to improve upon your work. Always focus on that first and foremost, and leave everything else (marketing, image) completely secondary. Obviously, easier said than done when you're trying to make a living, but if you can move along those lines and earnestly try to make things that you really enjoy it can only benefit you in the long run. Good luck!"
[INPUT]: Have you ever had a guest come on the podcast that you regretted or thought perhaps you should have done more research on before inviting on?
"[Joe Rogan]: Not really, because even the ones that were weird or off, I just sort of turn to redban and we start fucking around. The whole thing has been a real learning process and I don't think that would be possible without the sucky podcasts being in the mix."
"[INPUT]: When speaking with Neil DeGrasse Tyson, you told him you realized thinking the moon landing could have been faked was kinda silly and got him on your side and then started bringing up all these Youtube clips for him to watch that shows it may have been faked. Did you really change your opinion on the moon landing or was it your way to set him up for some honest opinions on what most consider crazy to even consider?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I love ""conspiracy theories."" Always have. I'm not sure if the origins of that are from some deep seated distrust of authority, or just what little information I have that's provable of known fuckery that leads me to ponder how much we don't know. That said, I try to always have an open mind when it comes to almost everything, and I try to group my possibilities into camps of likely and unlikely based on the thinking of the brightest minds and their take on the subject."
"When I do that with the moon landing clearly the brightest minds and the most trustworthy sources believe the landings actually happened. That said I not-so-secretly hold out hope that some stunning piece of evidence would emerge that throws the entire subject into chaos. Why? Because I'm a silly bitch and I get a rush out of dumb shit like that. That's why I watch bigfoot shows, and that's why if I'm anywhere near a graveyard at night and there's no one around I'll get out of my car and look for ghosts for a few minutes if I have the time. Like I said, I'm a self professed silly bitch."
"If you asked me for an honest opinion, I would say that when you look at the evidence it's certainly most likely that we went to the moon. That said, that's not nearly the dumbest thing I've held out hope for. For a long time I was fascinated by these things called ""roswell rods."" There was this video about them detailing this fascinating new life form that could only be caught on video because they moved too fast for the human eye. I watched a few shows on this subject, and spent hours discussing it and even contemplated getting a video camera to see if I could find them in my neighborhood."
"Well, it turns out that these stupid fucking things were just bugs filmed with cameras that couldn't quite keep up with the movement of the bugs so it would create this weird video artifact that made them look like tubular flying squids. They cracked the mystery on the show ""Monster Quest."""
"That might have actually been the only positive thing that ever came out of that monster quest show. Other than that, ever episode was them pretending they might have found a monster only to disappoint the fuck out of you in the end. Really it was a hilarious premise, because there should be absolutely no suspense in those shows in this day and age, because if they had actually found some real monster we would have heard about it online way before the episode ever aired."
[INPUT]: What do you think is the most positive thing someone can realistically do to change the world?
"[Joe Rogan]: I think the best thing we can do to change the world is to inspire young people. The more people realize that the key to happiness in life is to surround yourself with good friends, to be a good friend, to challenge yourself in honest ways, to not take short cuts but rather to rise to the challenge and grow from the struggle. To not be jealous of each other's success but rather be inspired by it. The more we realize that the key to happiness doesn't lay in numbers in a bank account but in the way we make others feel and the way they make us feel. The values of true community."
"Although these values are massively important and resonate with every honest person when they're discussing ""meaning"" and ""happiness"" in life, they're not taught in school. We learn the building blocks of mathematics, the fundamentals of language, the facts of history - but we never learn how to manage our minds. We never learn how to live by a code and to surround yourself with like-minded people and to inspire and encourage each other."
"Occasionally we're fed clumsy, abstract shit like ""think positive!"" but no one ever gives us a clear path of what the fuck that means. No one ever tells you that all the success in the world will leave you a miserable wreck of a person if you stab your brothers and sisters in the back in your attempt to reach victory. No one ever tells you that all the money in the world ain't worth shit if no one gives a fuck about you and you have no friends."
"The quicker we all realize that we've been taught how to live life by people that were operating on the momentum of an ignorant past the quicker we can move to a global ethic of community that doesn't value invented borders or the monopolization of natural resources, but rather the goal of a happier more loving humanity."
"People can still make money and still find success while doing it all ethically. We live in a time where we're seeing corporations acting as remorseless, profit seeking monsters with each human part required to keep it moving feeling free of guilt because of the diffusion of responsibility that comes with being a single piece in a huge machine. Too many people have the attitude that this is the only way to do big business. That's a pile of weak bullshit, and this generation may be one of the first generations that has the information available to make that distinction and stop that flawed model from being acceptable."
"The more people require the highest level of friendship and love of themselves the more other people will be inspired by them. If that sounds like some hippy, utopian bullshit... it's because it is. It also might be the only way people are ever really going to change. One person inspiring another, each commiting to upholding a higher standard until it becomes the norm."
"Humanity has changed drastically over the past few thousand years. It used to be when people you didn't know showed up in town they were there to rape and murder. Now, they're tourists and they're welcomed with open arms as a valuable part of the global economy. One day I believe that if we don't blow ourselves up, or poison ourselves with polution, or get wiped out by a super-bug or an asteroid impact we'll slowly come to the understanding that we really are just one species, and that the only way to truly be happy is if everyone around you is happy as well."
"[INPUT]: Have any desire to podcast with the RZA? His interviews and books show a supremely intelligent, interesting mind. I know you like Wu-Tang, plus he follows you on Twitter...so I mean it only seems right!"
"[Joe Rogan]: I would love to. There's a lot of people I would love to get on the podcast, but there's only so many days in a week and lately I've had more possibilities and desires for guests than I've had time."
"It's a good problem to have. Hopefully one day we can make it happen. I would have never thought that a year or two ago, but after David Lee Roth it seems like almost anything is possible."
[INPUT]: What's the hardest you've ever bombed on stage?
"[Joe Rogan]: I've eaten shit onstage with spectacularly disastrous results, but if I had to isolate the worst time ever I would have to say it was around 1992 in a weekend I worked with Jim Breuer."
"It was a perfect storm of conditions that led to the most epic bombing moment for me; first of all I was headlining, and I really had no business closing any professional comedy show. I had only been doing stand up for 4 years, and although I could have some good sets now and again, I really had no solid stand up chops, and if anything went wrong I didn't have the experience, the talent or the material to stop the show from going off the rails."
"I had just moved to NY and gotten a new manager, and I exaggerated how much time I could do so that he would get me work as a headliner. I really only had about 20 solid minutes of time, and that would only work under ideal conditions. On this particular weekend there was a whole laundry list of shit that was wrong. I had just broken up with my girlfriend. I had just torn my ACL ligament in my knee and for the first time in my adult life I couldn't work out to blow off steam and get my head straight. It was also a time where my new manager had convinced me that I should ""dress nice"" onstage. I was wearing some idiotic outfit that I would wear if I was going out to a club to try to get laid, and I felt particularly not funny dressed that way. That night it was the first and only time I tried dressing that way."
"Jim and I were in the same boat at the time, and he could have headlined just as easily as I could have. We were both doing comedy for about the same amount of time, and although he was probably a bit stronger an act than me at the time, the shows all went well until the late show Saturday night."
"The first show was weak, but I got through it. The second show however saw Jim in RARE form. He just fucking destroyed. I mean obliterated the room. It was one of the strongest sets I had ever seen at the time. He did well all weekend, but on this particular show he really caught a gear and took it to the next level. He had this closing bit about coming home drunk and his mom was a demon. It was a fucking hilarious bit, and that night he just smashed it out of the park. His closing bit was incredibly powerful, and he beat that audience into submission. It was really awesome to see, but backstage I was shitting my pants."
"I was backstage watching him from the sidelines, and I knew I was fucked. I was standing there dressed like a club going douche bag, limping on my bum knee thinking about how my ex girlfriend is probably long over me and getting plowed by some new guy right now while I'm waiting to go onstage and make a feeble attempt to stretch my shitty 20 minutes out into a 45 minute closing act after watching Jim Breuer have one of the most explosively funny sets I've ever seen."
"I went onstage scared, and from the moment the first words came out of my mouth I sucked. It was humiliating. I somehow managed to stay up there for 35 minutes while the audience was moaning and telling me I sucked. After it was over I was seriously wondering if I had what it took to make it as a comic. I was devastated."
"What came next after the humiliation settled though, was a newfound determination and focus. I now knew what the highest level of eating shit onstage felt like, and I wanted to make sure that never happened again. In the next 6 months my act improved tremendously. I tightened up old bits and through out ones that were dead weight. I wrote new stuff and put much more time into performing and writing. I took the whole process to a completely different level."
"When I look back now there were several times where I bombed onstage, and although every one of them sucked hard at the time, the terrible feeling that came with bombing motivated me to improve more than any good set I ever got. Two things happened that night; one was that I realized I had no business headlining, and that I needed to seriously overhaul my act and get to work. The other was that Jim Breuer really inspired me."
"If I hadn't had to follow him I would have still been inspired, but because I did have to go onstage after him and I had to compare my performance in the same crowd as his, and realize there was no one to blame for my shitty performance but me it was a real learning experience."
"It was a terrible experience at the time, but ultimately a very important learning moment for me, and it marked a very important growth point for my career. I never forgot that night, and although it doesn't haunt me, I will forever remember that feeling that comes with being out of line and disrespecting (even if unintentionally) the brutal nature of the art of stand up. That bombing made me a much better comic."
[INPUT]: What is your favorite book that you have read?
"[Joe Rogan]: Fiction - probably either Steven King's ""Pet Cemetery"" or ""Christine"" and non-fiction ""The War Of Art"" By Steven Pressfield."
"The reason those two Steven King books are my favorite has as much to do with the time in my life in which I was reading them as it does the content. I've always been a huge fan of Steven King. I just really enjoy that kind of book where there's no obligation to be realistic, and his imagination can take you on the craziest of rides where a car can possess the soul of a dead man, or the next door neighbor could become a werewolf."
"Also, when I was reading those books for the first time it was when I was riding the T into Boston to take Tae Kwon Do classes and I was on a wild adventure in my life. It was the first time in my life I felt like I was accomplishing anything. It was a 30 minute ride into town ever day, and I looked forward to Steven King books to keep me company."
"The war of art is an amazing non fiction book that's really been inspirational to me and many of my friends. I believe I found out about it from a John Mayer tweet, and once I started reading it I was hooked. I actually bought many copies and handed them out to friends. Many people that I gave it to said that the book changed the way they approached their craft - be it music, writing, comedy, even people involved in non-creative businesses. It's a powerful book about the creative process."
"[INPUT]: In your interview with Cara Santa Maria you expressed the view that consciousness has little to do with nonclassical effects in the brain. However, in your interviews with Dr. Amit Goswami and Dr. Bruce Lipton you seemed sympathetic to less mainstream ideas like Penrose's Orch-OR (which apparently gets 9% of the vote in a poll of experts in quantum foundations). In light of the info above would you consider interviewing Sir Roger Penrose or Hartmut Neven (a Google employee) about their respective views on nonclassical happenings in the human brain (1, 2)?"
Both Stuart Hameroff (Penrose's coauthor) and Hartmut talk about psychedelics (ayahuasca in the latter case) in lectures at Google.
"[Joe Rogan]: I've entertained just about every feasible idea in terms of the origins of human consciousness. I would be far more conservative in my willingness to contemplate radical ideas if I hadn't had psychedelic experiences, but since I have, and since those experiences have been WAY weirder than anything I could have possibly imagined prior to taking those psychedelics I leave room for a lot of possibilities."
"Often times, whether I'm talking to someone who is skeptical like Cara, or someone who is almost certainly out to lunch like Melissa Ethridge, what I'm trying to do is get them to expand on their beliefs as far as they're willing to take it. This can often get people thinking that I believe what they believe, or disbelieve what they're skeptical of. Most of the time though, I'm just trying to get in their head."
"I try to not believe anything. ""Try"" is the key word, because my mind bounces back and forth occasionally with decisions and judgment, but my honest intentions are always to remain as open as possible."
"I don't know if consciousness is resolved in the brain, or if the brain is just a biological antenna tuned to the intelligence of the universe, using the firing of neurons to decode reality. That certainly sounds like the sexier idea, but ultimately I'm in the ""who the fuck knows"" camp."
"I would LOVE to get either Sir Roger Penrose or Harmut Neven on the podcast. Them, and a thousand more brilliant, mind blowing people. Any and all. It's the most beautiful thing about the podcast; getting to have conversations with all these fascinating people that would be almost impossible to hold down for a 3 hour conversation without it."
"[INPUT]: Joe I love the podcasts, especially the one with Les Stroud. So are you and Les still planning on the search for Bigfoot in British Columbia?"
"[Joe Rogan]: We've talked about it recently in email, but nothing has been set in stone. We talked about Northern California and Alaska as well, as Alaska is where Les had his own bigfoot encounter."
"Normally I listen to bigfoot stories with one eyebrow firmly raised, but when Les told his story I didn't sense an ounce of bullshit. If I had to bet the ranch on whether or not bigfoot was real I would lean towards no, but holy fuck would it be awesome if I was wrong."
[INPUT]: I just want to say thank you for calling out Carlos Mencia for being a joke stealer and a talentless hack. What motivated you to call him out?
[Joe Rogan]: Having a thief creeping around a comedy club is a stifling thing. It's a terrible feeling especially for young unknown comics that are terrified that this person is going to take from them and leave them with no recourse. It's also really frustrating when you find out that no one is willing to do anything about a thief as long as there's profit to be made.
"I had never seen a plagiarist on that level before, in person on a regular basis. It was like having a creative vampire that haunted the hallways and we had to all band together to make sure none of us were turned into his victims. Instead of crosses and stakes we had code words we would shout out when he was in the room so that the comic onstage would stop doing material and would start just doing ad-lib crowd work until he left."
"I never meant to ""call him out"" but when he challenged me that night to come up onstage and ""say that shit to his face"" I was more than happy to do so. It was something that had been building up at the comedy store for a long, long time, and after it was over it really did feel like we took down a monster."
"I think in the long run it's better for him this way too. Karma is some real shit, and running around profiting off of stealing shit from people for that long has got to tax the shit out of your self esteem unless you're a serious sociopath."
"[INPUT]: I've seen you talk about the futility of drug prohibition, but have you considered doing more to get involved in ending the war on drugs? Teaming up with a nonprofit organization like the Drug Policy Alliance could go a long way. Think about it."
"[Joe Rogan]: I think the best thing that I can do other than voting (which I'm not entirely convinced helps on the federal level) is voice displeasure and do my best to make the war on drugs look like the ridiculous shell game that it is. Information is our best weapon, and slowly but surely the paradigm that's in place now is becoming unsustainable. If you have other ideas that you really believe in I would be happy to listen though. I'll follow you on twitter now."
"[INPUT]: What has been the most surreal moment for you on the podcast? Talking to Neil Tyson, David Lee Roth? You even admitted conversations like those would have been impossibilities for you before the podcast existed. Love the podcast - keep it up."
"[Joe Rogan]: Neil Tyson and David Lee Roth were both equally bizarre. Maynard from tool was weird as fuck too, especially since he reached out to me on twitter. I can remember looking at his tweet thinking, ""Am I really fucking talking online to Maynard from TOOL and is he really fucking saying that he wants to do my podcast?"" Until he walked up to me and shook my hand I wasn't really sure if it was actually him I was talking to online. That was a fucking trip."
"What a cool motherfucker he was too. Man, I love that guy."
[INPUT]: How many times a day do people quote that Dave Chappelle Fear Factor skit at you?
"[Joe Rogan]: It's pretty rare now, except on twitter. On twitter it's several times a week. During the heyday of the Chappelle show though it was a DAILY thing. Everywhere I went people would scratch their neck and say, ""There's something you might not know about me, Joe Rogan..."""
[INPUT]: What are your thoughts on bitcoin?
"[Joe Rogan]: Quite honestly I'm absolutely fascinated by the idea, but I haven't given it my full attention. I've sort of been sitting back watching it from a distance and waiting to see if it takes root. If it does, I honestly think it could really shake up the global economy. Obviously we can see from our own controversial bailouts, and the shit that's going down in Cyprus that the system that's in place right now is massively flawed and being managed by fucking criminals. I'll look further into bitcoin. Lord knows we could use some new options."
[INPUT]: How do you expand your conciousness?
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't think it's ever easy. It requires focus, experience, reflection - none of those are really easy. The key seems to be getting on a path of intent. Wanting to expand your consciousness is one of the most important aspects of actually doing it."
I've met a lot of people that have done massive amounts of mushrooms but they remain idiots.
"[Joe Rogan]: I don’t think they understood well. There’s no talk of gluten intolerance when we were young—that didn’t exist. There was no understanding of excess carbs, and excess carbs leads to excess body weight, and it makes makes you store fat. People didn’t think about it that way. The thing about nutrition science is a it’s a body of knowledge that’s constantly added to."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, in fact perhaps most things are who knows what misapprehensions and ignorant sweet toil on the earth that will be revealed to us do you do any I feel like I’ve heard you talk about hormone stuff yeah yeah"
[Joe Rogan]: I do hormone replacement what type of things testosterone in human growth hormone you have to give yourself a jab in there yeah you get in the thigh thigh you won’t do the arse Apple pride mrs. Rogan its eyes right there it’s easy to grab yeah but they also have taking hold like so
[INPUT]: You’re taking growth hormones? Have you noticed any negative side-effects?
[Joe Rogan]: Your blood is monitored. When you’re doing something like that this isn’t this is also if you’re a person that has addictive problems addiction problems which I don’t necessarily have them as much with substances what do I let them leave well you saw with video games when you got here the video game problem that I have
[INPUT]: yeah you frantic you merge that at darkroom you and your sweaty sweaty and pie-eyed and baffled by the one –
[Joe Rogan]: I’ve been addicted to martial arts. I’ve been addicted to playing pool. I get addicted to getting good at things. I get very addicted to things if there’s something that I get obsessed with like jiu-jitsu or whatever it is… and that’s all I think about all day long. It’s not healthy. With hormones you want to make sure that you don’t overdose yourself. Make sure that you stay within a narrow range where you have healthy levels of a person that’s in their late 20s. You want you don’t want to have hyper-human levels. Some people do.
[INPUT]: hyper human you’re gonna create an audio system
[Joe Rogan]: You’re fucking up your body man. You’re just jolting yourself with all this extra shit.
[INPUT]: sweet lady thyroid is that part of your system
[Joe Rogan]: I take thyroid. It’s actually made from pig thyroid. (do you mean pigs fire roads now yeah hold on wait how what’s happened to the pig?) they’re long gone they’re not so straddling over lack of thyroid teetering about all emasculated well this is like so
[INPUT]: yeah I’m interested in this hormone stuff I’m interested in that but you know me I’ve got to be very very cautious about Moodle or in yeah stuff yeah
[Joe Rogan]: If you have the exercise regimen that you’re talking about I don’t think you have got to do what it takes man
[INPUT]: yeah bring me the pill shock that thyroid out of it directly
"[Joe Rogan]: You should eat eggs though man. You should eat should eat some animal protein. If you oppose the moral aspect of killing an animal… I totally understand and appreciate. That’s what led me to become a hunter in the first place. I was really uncomfortable watching these animal rights videos of factory farming. I thought it was disgusting. I was like, “I don’t want to participate in this”. It’s reprehensible. Hunting is a different thing, man. To me, hunting is intense; it’s very spiritual in a way. I mean, people don’t get it because they see you celebrating when it’s over. It’s very difficult to close in on a wild animal."
[INPUT]: What are you hunting?
"[Joe Rogan]: Mostly elk. Well, Elk’s my favorite for two reasons"
"[INPUT]: So you’re out stalking an elk on the plains? Where are you, like near where you live?"
"[Joe Rogan]: You do travel on bikes if you whitetail hunt. You go into the woods with bikes because they don’t leave a scent the way your feet do. (mm-hmm) Animals don’t associate the sound of a bike the way they associate the sound of stepping bipedal hominids. (having to evolve trail bipedal yeah?) They see you on a bike, they’re freaked out as much delightful never seen my brain what are these things? yeah"
"[INPUT]: Elk, are they like herd animals?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I see a herd of them, and try to figure out which way the winds blowing. You try to get close to them. Is this a video of us? Yeah, this is a beautiful place."
[INPUT]: I can see the heart of nature now the fingers of me I see that elk there and I sort of feel like a sort of I’ve watched too much disney um you know like I see that elk and I feel like I’m Bambi literally you know like I don’t have E it later Lee in the morning you look yeah tired not tired
[Joe Rogan]: mine only afternoon actually till those late afternoon
"[INPUT]: I would love the game. I’ve had to go down gun ranges, it turns out I’m a pretty good shot. It’s nice to see that thing come back, we’ve like holes around this abdomen. It’s I think satisfying. There you’ve dealt with a paper man. But like… the elk? I couldn’t. I’ve got too much empathy in me. I couldn’t deal with the feeling of after it was shot. I’m almost thinking about the sentimentality of it. I’ve sentimentalized it. now you know at least I had don’t eat meat and stuff like that so it’s not like I have all those feelings. But I can handle it in a packaged portioned off way. yeah it’s just I feel too much like oh that creature. So what’s in your head when you’re doing it? When you’re pulling the trigger, what’s going on in your mind?"
"[Joe Rogan]: You are only hunting mature animals that have already passed on their genes. You also are recognizing that if you’re not killing these things, it’s not like they’re gonna live forever. They live a short. A short life, with a very violent death. It’s either wolves, mountain lions, bears, or something’s gonna take them out. What you’re doing is essentially dipping your toe into the natural world. I’ve heard the argument, “Well, this is ridiculous. Not everyone can do that. If everyone went out and hunted all the animals, there would be no animals left.” Which is true, but I’m not everyone. I’m still going to use the “if everyone did” argument because it’s a good argument. If you’re encouraging people to hunt, it is kind of a good argument because it’s not realistic. It’s not sustainable. The other thing to recognize is the reason why most of this wildlife exists in the first place. A lot of it was wiped out in the early 20th century from what they call market hunting. in the late late 19th century early 20th century they you know they didn’t have refrigeration and it was hard to get food and we didn’t have the same sort of large-scale agriculture that we have today. and so when someone would want meat they would someone he would either have to hunt it for you and you would go to the market and and get that hunted food or you would go out and do it yourself. and they basically wiped out most of the wildlife in North America to the point of extinction whitetail deer elk they’ve been extirpated from the majority of their range in North America and only been replaced in a few other places. but the places with there been replaced it’s all through money that was generated through hunting tags. all through billions and billions of dollars. there’s a thing called the Robertson pikmin I think that’s what’s called act where 10% if you buy hunting gear and equipment 10% of that money goes to habitat restoration, making sure that rangers and forest people get funded, so that the Fish and Game Department gets funded, and all and also population conservation. making sure that the populations are healthy, repopulating certain areas with elk and deer. and this has all been done through the money that’s generated through hunting."
"[INPUT]: yeah I can see that there isn’t looking at my own feelings too I can see that there’s a potentially I’m bringing a sentimentality to the idea of animals that’s like anthropomorphic. yes oh you can’t kill that it what about its babies you know it like I’m thinking about things like that. but what I you know I live in a rural area in Britain where like hunting is normal, and I wouldn’t and agriculture is normal and I wouldn’t get very far if I was sort of oh you can’t chew those pheasants look at their feathers they’re beautiful! you know I mean like you wouldn’t it’s not a help for watching so whilst I like record like in myself I couldn’t do that because like I don’t it messes me up on a sort of a feels like a very deep visceral level you know like but I feel that this is precisely the kind of territory where we have to look at acknowledging and tolerate indifference between us. this is where I feel like the sort of these ossified polarized positions between right and left are starting to take root. because if someone like me who don’t eat meat don’t eat animal products and wouldn’t hunt for ethical reasons, starts trying to impose on other people now you shouldn’t have because of this that have you not watched Bambi you know like that’s gonna mean that people aren’t able to explore who they are. it’s that and so my I’ve let go of judging people around things that I don’t agree with because I reckon I don’t know everything. you know I mean I’m this this is like this is about my morality is about how I behave. and if people said to me I’m thinking about going hunting I go well these are my feelings about it however though I just heard that hunting does contribute apparently the survival to some species and there is an argument that it’s quite natural in indigenous and it’s probably a way of getting in contact with who we are originally as hunting people is an important part of our anthropological history and possibly a lot of the condemnation of hunting is part of the rejection of who we used to be is we become overly civilized and more and more than detatched from what it is to be human whether that sacred or pragmatic we don’t know what human beings are anymore we reject our own sexuality we reject their own bodies, we reject you know we’re trying to turn ourselves in these sort of cyborgs. these emotionless sexless meaningless creatures where is our passion where is our connection the sacred? they would go hold on only after about hunting. when are you gonna stop talking? never! gave me I will pummel you with my belief system on other things yeah like so I don’t feel like that ain’t we’re getting the judging people um but like I’m interested as well with this I keep bringing up the subject of DMT like what I guess what I want to know about is like because I’m you know obviously a person in recovery I don’t drink I don’t take drugs haven’t done for a long time and I recognized for certain people that they can’t do it safely. psychedelics and hallucinogens it seemed to me exist in a realm outside of that because they’re not about they’re not pleasure-seeking there’s like seems to me like it’s a spiritual pool however I’m a crafty bastard when it comes to this stuff and I’m always looking for an in. you know when I see your cannabis treasure-trove over there I mean that is some yeah as you said the let Raiders of the Lost Ark stuff and I’m holding in my hand now the CBD rich cannabis soft gels clasp in it. you know so I’m worried that"
[Joe Rogan]: that is a gateway that CBD which is not necessarily psycho psycho back it’s not but it does help you with anxiety it helps a lot of people because alleviates a lot of inflammation which tends to have a corresponding impact on on your anxiety
[INPUT]: okay so this says here 11 milligrams of THC does that mean I mean it says THC you just say that the bottom the probably wonder one this is the wonder one might be already 18 to 1 or 11 it says there’s an 11 is
[INPUT]: a couple different ones in that boxI give you almost like a smack don’t take that this one goes this one this one’s way more powerful everyone
[INPUT]: you seem do you seem very relaxed and free from anxiety great I will say that but like what I suppose I’m interested in because I listen I’m meditating the whole like I meditate a lot I’m doing all these things I’m experiencing transcendent States. I’m experiencing what it’s like to not feel attached to my identity as Russell who are you before you are Russel?l who are you before you identify yourself as a man in England? who are you who is the person? who is the consciousness who is the awareness then when I listen to say Terence Mckenna talking about his experiences in psychic such length and with such lucidity and with so many philosophical connotations. and the way that he uses the information he’s getting from Hallucigenia experiences to speculate on how we should organize society. what what the implications are for freedom. his refusal to accept that there are certain kind of experiences that should be prohibited that it’s ridiculous that adults should be prevented from having that. I I’m fascinated by I’m also I suppose part of my biases. I love anything that gets me out of my head I feel a tremendous sense of relief whether it’s through meditation or even sport the or sex being relieved of the burden of the constantly thinking mind. but when I hear like those vivid descriptions of DMT realm or wesker I think something in me hungers for that hungers for it
[Joe Rogan]: do you worry that you’re trying to get intoxicated you worry that you’re but you’re trying to find a loophole
[INPUT]: yeah because I am doing that I’m I’m looking for a loophole I go around trash lawyer looking for some way
[Joe Rogan]: yeah I mean I know people that have problems with addiction that I’ve done psychedelics and didn’t have a problem. but I’m sure some people have had problems and I don’t know about them DMT is interesting in that first of all it’s very quick. the experience is only about 15 minutes 20 minutes max. and it’s also it’s not necessary it’s not an intoxicant in the way that you would think about traditionally. you are still you in in the face of this experience. and I think I think it’s some sort of a chemical gateway. and that’s what I think I think there’s a gateway in your mind that can lead to some other dimension that’s probably there all the time
[INPUT]: if there is a omnipresent continually existign realm that human beings aren’t accessing because of that particular biochemical formulation of consciousness as it is in this point in our evolution yeah and that we can get there and it seems as like you know I’ve heard Terence Mckenna say it’s more real you know it’s more real there’s stuff in there you know and excuse me and when he talks about them beings you know like that he describes herself dribbling basketballs creating Faberge egg Lion of iDevice his fruit vibration
[Joe Rogan]: I didn’t see it I never saw one he’s called the Machine Elms he’s called them all sorts of different things the way I’ve described them is they’re the geometric patterns made out of love and understanding. they seem like so you’ve read you can look at a geometrical pattern and read meaning into it? had an emotional quality
[INPUT]: they’re made out of somethig? and they move they change like they don’t stay what they are they’re constantly evolving in front of you into something more and more beautiful it’s very weird
[INPUT]: what did it make you feel
[Joe Rogan]: like I knew nothing there was the most profound aspect like all of this stuff that you concentrate on every day is nonsense and there is some other thing that’s connected that’s probably influencing this world yeah and it’s probably what with people see when they have near-death experiences the depictions of the afterlife I mean that’s probably what it all is and religious experience is when prophets are talked about
[INPUT]: oh my god I went into this realm there’s these beings I’ve told me we’re all one we have
[Joe Rogan]: scholars scholars in Jerusalem are connecting Moses’s experience with the burning bush to the acacia tree the acacia tree which is rich in DMT the burning bush is what God was to Moses and that through this burning bush he came out with these 10 commandments of how people should live their lives. I mean that easily could have been just a very convoluted sort of translation of a DMT trip
"[INPUT]: certainly and also when you think of certainly there are archetypal images that seem to be repeated through our ancient cultures on an archaic stories that seem to refer to the potential for plant experiences to affect consciousness even the Garden of Eden do not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge otherwise you will become as gods. you know alike I sense that now if if there is some realm that we can reach through that experience, but see that puts into perspective everything that else we experience on the material realm, and that thing seems to in your words be emanate in love and understanding while ever-changing completely formless and communicate in love and understanding. for I can’t help but think that that should become our priority to have a relationship with that girl and to bring about that experience. I don’t even mean in a literal way because even Terence Mckenna said there are some people venerable rubble souls"
[Joe Rogan]: he was probably referring to people like me that probably shouldn’t mess around with that kind of stuff really talking about people with schizophrenia rather which he believed he had by the way today yeah he he had some very unique perspectives on schizophrenia the the way people interact with the world itself. I think if we lived in a healthy world a healthy civilization that had a healthy relationship with psychoactive substances we’d probably have centres where you would have a legitimate shaman a medical adviser and someone would take you through a guided experience. we’re doing that now with Ketamine there’s a lot of people that are very depressed that are having these physician controlled ketamine experiences that have had a profound effect on their depression my friend Neil Brendan’s gone through several of them. and he was he’s a comedian a very funny comedian so when he was describing it was hilarious I’m going to a doctor’s office and tripping his fucking balls off. you know and the doctors shooting him up with intramuscular ketamine. oh my god yeah and he’s having these insane yeah I go see you’re having psychedelic experiences like oh ya mean tripping his fucking balls off in these whatever states that ketamine I’ve never experienced ketamine I don’t know what it does but it’s apparently profoundly hallucinogenic. and you have wild crazy experiences on it. and for whatever reason it has a great impact on depression for a lot of people. I think it’s a perspective enhancer but it also does something to rewire the mind
[INPUT]: well what some of this suggests is that mental illness is a response to our material conditions whether that mental illness is schizophrenia depression or addiction is like like people have gone wrong hang on a minute listen how we’re supposed to live. I took that came in one time towards the end of my using and it as usual it’s not in the right type of environment. we doing stuff and a nightclub you need to be under that shamanic conditions why or whatever whoever you know nominate is a shaman. but I felt like it was like going into a tunnel made of sound and I having to navigate it I’m still in reality we’re gonna do it as myself consciousness becomes a noise yeah instead of a string of words and signs you know I’m gonna get out of this place. you know so like for me it’s clear that drugs were never meant to be recreational in fact they never worked I was never hey man this is crazy I was like I’m fucking pain I need some shit to help me out otherwise I’m gonna probably kill myself. yeah you know so like it was a way of holding that stuff at arm’s length. so I guess my renewed curiosity around DMT and ayahuasca and other sort of plant medicines and like you know that do you know Daniel Pinchbeck and like them guys that are sort of part of that I’m curious about it because I guess I’m continually trying to find a way with someone go right here’s a way where we can do it where it’s sort of safe and I’ve heard of other people in recovery doing it. and when I think about what my motivation is is when I hear people talking about and my own and my own recollections of experiencing what felt like god and by God I mean a sense of oneness and that my individual identity isn’t my real identity and I’m connected to everything and love is the most important thing you know III want a real experience of that so that. when I’m out in the world I can remember when I’m driving or when I’m dealing with people or if I’m buying something or if I’m feeling inferior or feeling superior that like you said this is bullshit! this is like a secondary reality don’t let it govern you! you know as someone that’s been seduced by fame a person life if I get this pons film then everyone’s gonna love me oh if this stand-up set goes well you know like a person’s placed all of my well-being outside of myself. the certain knowledge that there is an inner connection that will take care of you that’s accessible I guess I’m you know hungry to sort of feel it in a way that’s like oh my god now there is no doubt so in a sense is a crisis of faith no twice in
[Joe Rogan]: psychedelic states that you could achieve without taking anything I mean you can certainly get there in a floatation tank you could get there through holotropic breathing I’ve never done kundalini yoga but apparently the people that get really deep into Kundalini oh you can literally have DMT trips yeah I have friends that have done DMT and have experienced DMT trips through Kundalini but you have to be really dedicated I mean there’s a lot of time a lot of time a lot of energy and you have to really understand the methods and and follow them to a tee and you can achieve these altered states of consciousness that are apparently you know not for my personal experience but from people telling me incredibly profound
[INPUT]: yeah I mean I’ve had comparable things I guess but what it’s you know the difference between feeling something that’s that overwhelming that gives you no choice you know like this like it’s not like in a Kundalini you got do these breaths correctly you got to sit there you go try again have you done it yeah done quite a bit really knee well what for me feel like what I felt quite a lot yogic Lee and meditatively is a cessation of what I would call my individual consciousness. like oh I’m not this this isn’t Who I am this is just a temporary experience and all of the value systems of our world are built upon these primal drives in collaboration with a culture the like the stratified people and manage people and operates like a massive farm where it’s easier to keep people together operating in these kind of way systemically. I’ve sort of felt rushes of that like a certain wordless clarity if you can imagine me having anything that was wordless even for a moment and like and in that space you know there was there is great peace. so I suppose get that what’s turning me on about the like the DMT and ayahuasca thing is that the way it’s narrative iced that there you’re gonna meet characters and stuff like that and it’s and it’s gonna be plain and beyond doubt you know because I suppose what prophets do you know like whether it you know when a prophet returns from there whether it’s the burning bush or the cave they come back and they say all this stuff that you’re taking seriously is not real. there’s this other realm start prioritizing it or you are gonna live in Hell on earth. you’re gonna be governed by your materialistic drives your sexual drive and it’s going to imprison you. and it turns out that they’re right! and so like you know I suppose what I’m after because I’m partly you know on a superfood like I’m one level influenced by what you’re doing and how you’ve created your own like your create your own business and your own success like this this symbiosis of stand-up and the podcast and like it’s become like a sort of a lifestyle brand in a sense Joe like you know I’m sort of like yeah I don’t I don’t want to be continually dragged in and he’s collected like working within institution. it’s like you know I I’m over here doing a bloody I’m doing bullets and I’m bloody glad to be over here doing ballers and working with the rock and I’ve got a funny story about that if you want it but like you know like really what interests me is like can I be and that can I dedicate my life to humorously communicating spiritual information and indeed starting to live it so later and I suppose what that would mean is you know I’m getting better but I’m not a person who’s obsessed with porn or sex or drugs or like you know to become it to become what you actually are to recognize that we’re all different. your perfect realization of you is going to involve Huynh in and all of these things that you’ve created through your gift and that my perfect version of me is gonna you know involve all of this and not everyone needs to build sort of empires or entertainment histories or whatever but all of us are on some journey to self-actualization and realization as individual as our fingerprints and as natural as a seed turning into a tree and if we don’t have a way of accessing that no wonder with this ice right no wonder we tie there’s an opioid epidemic no wonder people are bored and angry and lonely
[Joe Rogan]: well I think what you can do is be yourself and what you can do is express yourself and what you can do is constantly seek to improve and grow and you are doing those things so if you’re saying can I do these things? can I be comedic and spiritual? and what you’re doing it right so it’s don’t you’re doing it you know it’s all just a matter of what whether or not you’re satisfied with your progress and where you are and who you are and how you express yourself
[INPUT]: so your pursuit for excellence when you’re saying I’ve got to get better at BJJ or archery on in or whatever that isn’t coupled with a sort of sense because you’re not fucking good enough that’s they don’t see or dive cause wonderment yeah I love it Julie joy in it and
"[Joe Rogan]: there’s enthusiasm I mean in everything archery in particular it’s very you know there’s that book Zen in the art of archery which is it’s an interesting book. it’s you know I mean I think there’s some real great points to it but that state of mind that you get when you release an arrow, and that arrow perfectly finds its mark really is Zen. it’s you it requires so much concentration and focus and technique that you really don’t think about other things beautiful it’s cleansing and ways. its mind cleansing. I find jiu-jitsu to be very similar in that way to that it’s so all-encompassing it’s so there’s so much on the line it’s so difficult to do that while it’s happening you’re freeing your mind up I mean I think of video games in the same way"
[INPUT]: all of these things all of those things suggest a transmission between the inner and outer world isn’t it you’re looking at the bull’s eye and then oh my god I made this thing Traverse time and space or BJJ I’ve been shown again and again how to execute his triangle and I’ve just actually done it against resistance. it’s amazing to feel that. it’s amazing to feel that your inner life can express itself in the material world whatever well wherever you’re looking to explore that
[Joe Rogan]: and to test yourself and when you test yourself and you have to figure your way through something or change the path because the path you are on was unsuccessful when you’re doing that it’s it’s really good for the mind and for the I hesitate to say the spirit because I think that word spirituality is so beaten down and abused
[INPUT]: you mean it become commodified yeah
"[Joe Rogan]: it’s like yeah it’s like when people call themselves a healer you really really are all healing each other. but I think there’s something to doing difficult tasks that it makes life easier. I really believe that I think it makes life more enjoyable I think it makes the bright colors brighter, and it makes the the dull colors even them even though the the bad moments if you have real positive experiences with difficult things that you choose to do on your own I think it mitigates most of the hassle of life"
"[INPUT]: yes I agree with that that is again and I’m not particular mote this book because I’d like all right we’ve however things do but the point of this mentorship is the idea that someone will exhibit qualities but you recognize you haven’t fully realized in yourself, and that you can sort of model them and realize them because later they you have those qualities"
[Joe Rogan]: Oh like Kevin hora we were talking about how a boy I find his positive it made me think so real
[INPUT]: it’s unbelievable on a practical level you know the way he’s building his stand up that fucking diligent and the amantha when he talked through his when he talked through his work schedule you caught you fetishize hard-working man I think. I’ve noticed about Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart buddy like you like the idea of men I’m up at those people asking – I’m in the cryo chamber
[Joe Rogan]: I don’t do that though I sleep in a lot of things that they don’t do okay but I also you know unlike the rock at least I do stand-up and Kevin does to stand up – obviously I don’t know if he does it as much or as often as I do because I do the clubs. I have a philosophy about what’s required to develop great stand-up that you have to do a lot of sets. you have to do a lot of numbers a lot of different places different environments and I found that out the hard way. through my best performances and my less good performances like what was missing and what did I gain?
[INPUT]: you like this yeah I think he’s a sort of an interesting debate you know I don’t know if it’s in stand-up world at large but it’s anything I’ve thought about a lot he’s like that as soon as I was able to have an audience that would come and see me I was like I’m out thank you God! I’m never putting myself through that shit again! thanks Dan hope feels the same way whether he’s amazing absolutely fantastic I completely agree and like because I fought like because what I feel like is that the comedy club environment warps your material because you’ve got a appeal to them. and I think you ain’t the fucking arbiters of truth you’ve drunk and crazy – am i mother fuckers so I get like I perform I’ll what I’ll do it’s like I’m what I’m doing to say at the moment is I’ll book the UCB like her or like places 100 200 or go Largo or put on events and I’m doing events while I’m in LA because I think all these people come and they love me and they bring me beads here’s some vegan cookies and
[Joe Rogan]: you gotta come to the college dorm and go on after Joey Diaz
[INPUT]: because I feel like I like a nurturing environment because I’ve done those fucking clubs and like you know an even Comedy Store and later night Comedy Store in LA you know as well as London and I thought oh Jesus thank God! and after so like I’m interested to you that’s part of that what I think some people could reductively refer to is machismo in you like that you go now I’m going in now
[Joe Rogan]: oh you know what it is it’s that guy that mounted you and went for the armbar and you escaped right it’s worth it because it was hard you’re like you realize if you if a child got on top of you and went for an armbar and you escaped you’d feel nothing. so when you’re at Largo you’re performing for children
[INPUT]: child stand up it’s like
[Joe Rogan]: you’re dressing with 100-pound women who just started yesterday it’s not the make-a-wish Foundation Russell then tell us your stories thank you
[INPUT]: thank you children the counter-arguments of nurses that therefore I am in an environment that is sympathetic and he is my audience and I’m not biasing I what you know the idea of it overcoming a greater obstacle completely appreciate what you’re saying. but say you believe in the purity of stand up as being some real expression of yourself as in the arrow hitting the bull’s eye. I feel like I have a vision of what I’m trying to achieve. and increasingly it’s becoming about I want my stand up. I want to hang on you know like as I’ve always done stories where I feel embarrassed and humiliated. but I want to hang off it ruminations on what I believe to be the nature of truth and I want people to come out of those things feeling loved validated accepted and that they’re good enough and that they can explore themselves you know that looks
[Joe Rogan]: more of a one-man show
[INPUT]: in a sense is though I don’t want to like sacrifice the laughs you know I mean I love the loss the loss WAIS where we’re at y
[Joe Rogan]: ou know you don’t have a sacrifice in a one-man show I mean you can certainly do a one-man show that would be really funny
[INPUT]: but say you start going into yeah that’s what I’m doing and I’m trying to build things like around 12 steps and trying to like doing things that people have some takeaway value from now like you know like trying to develop that after Joey Diaz in the store
[Joe Rogan]: there’s gonna be some resistance you are you aware of Hannah Gatsby and the controversial because you think about I haven’t seen it ya know what mister say I’m gonna see it but because what the end of comedy and all that kind of thing silly there’s no end of comedy but she what she’s doing people like. and there’s never you want sometimes it’s funny I mean maybe it’s stand-up comedy block it become a sort of quite aggressive towards illness yeah became like a TEDTalk almost oh yes apparently
"[INPUT]: I’m interested you know that’s you know yeah there’s enough room for everyone to exert to do whatever they’re doing. but like see at the beginning of my let’s call it career like I I used to not prepare at all I was still drinking the using I go up onstage I drop shit up I’d get into confrontation when I say chops you up I’d take up animals shit part animal parts I’ve got from butchers like like a skull we’ve all meat and stuff and sinew on it, chop it up for anyone’s release locusts get into confrontations of like so yeah exactly the reaction you’re having is the reaction they were having. like I was the front row I had like fights I’ve got scars on my body from Bad stand-up gigs. from a time where I go to a confrontation like I was making a point about pedophilia saying oh we’re all one cultural mind so when a particular pedofile is transgressed against a child were all responsible fuck well that’s how I’ve still got the scar on my leg that ham there Edinburgh in Scotland people didn’t take it well. what I was trying to do was like create I didn’t have the skills to chopped the experience than you know so is so under equipped. but like what I was trying to do was create environments that felt yeah I’m much better at doing that now. I can create that kind of an uncertainty in a room a kind of a sense of chaos and what’s happening and then bring it back you know I hope so a humorous conclusion where people feel safe and amused and all of that kind of stuff. now I think it’s you you cut like because I did cry and do that in comedy clubs and yeah it was conversation it’s not what people want so don’t you think that by prepping your stand-up in those environments that it biases you towards a type of stand-up comedy that is limited?"
"[Joe Rogan]: no because you can do that other stuff too you could always perform to your crowd and you could always expand on things to your crowd. but to really put it together without any fluff without any nonsense without being self-indulgent, with respecting the attention span of the audience that may or may not even be there to see you most likely is not if you go to a comedy club and there’s a large you know if you go to the Comedy Store any night of the week there’s 15 plus people on the marquee or on the list and the show starts at 8"
[INPUT]: you’re right because there’s a obviously in like the Comedy Store between now as you just described there’s a contract we’re here not grania to see you we’re it laughs every 15 seconds and like you know comics like you know like Robin Williams or Chappelle’s that you know the all-time great they when they go in and accept those conditions you know you’ve seen stuff I’m sure like of Robin Williams he’s just like walking around in the crowd in that very room do it’s like it’s like he’s doing the thing I’m talking about and he’s doing it there. you know that’s when you think yeah if you like I suppose I do get at that you’re road-testing it to a huge durability to an incredible degree if you can pull it off it
"[Joe Rogan]: yeah well think about every time you’re saying something when you’re you have a subject say say if you want to do you want to talk about the mentors that you have in life there’s it’s an open-ended approach. you have no idea what the correct way to say something is you try it you have you write it out you say this seems feasible let me try it this way. and oftentimes people never correct it or they never they never adjust it they never go back and improve it. they just say it in a certain way and figure out how to do it. when you’re doing it in front of a crowd you’re developing these things while also feeling the way people are reacting to them and feeling their attention span, and it makes you with proper reflection, and truly objective listening to your material it makes you change and shift and adjust things. you know hopefully in a positive way. get in and the more you do it the more you get a sense of “maybe this is clunky here and maybe I figure out a better way to say it” and"
[INPUT]: I agree but the counter-argument could be that it could buy us you two a sort of a lowest common denominator area say with that bit the way you talked about the Sun and you know it’s you know it you need it’s trying to kill you it gives you cancer you know like something like uh what was the journey of that bit of stand-up? is it’s not for me it’s like oh I think afore I try and make sure there’s a tag so I know where I’m going when I’m out there and then it’s a comparable process to yours you try your best to get rid of fluff or whatever so can you recall like what it’s like we know a you night after night going in with new bits of material packaged within things that you’re a little more confident?
"[Joe Rogan]: yeah and I put that bit on a special I can do it better now I know a better way to do it and that’s part of the problem with doing bits it’s like sometimes you release them on a special you have a better version of it now but my point of that was to perspective enhance.r to let people know that bit was about like understand what’s happening here. you are literally floating in infinity and it’s almost never discussed. you’re hurling through forever there’s a fireball in the sky it’s a million times bigger than Earth if you stare at it you’ll go blind it’s trying to give you cancer and if it’s not there you get sad. oh yeah you live in a dream like this is madness! your life is madness. (beautiful) yeah it is but I wanted a there’s something about that particular way of express it sure in short doses and short bursts. if you know if you stared it’ll go blind, it’s trying to give you cancer, if it’s not there you get sad. so in that short bursts like bits you know like wow yeah that is all those things are true like yeah it’s crazy there really is a fireball floating in the sky we’re just used to it. we live because of a floating million times bigger than the earth fireball. and I when you say if you could say something like that and make someone laugh, you can actually change the way they look at things. you can actually affect at least the way they look at things. we just say something sometimes it’s profound, sometimes it registers. but if you could say something and it forces someone to laugh even if they disagree with you if they’re laughing like I didn’t fucking agree with this but holy shit this is funny! you put that thought deep into someone’s head. and you allow them to think about your thought process and and how your creative process and what you’re doing to sort of bring these things out"
[INPUT]: yes I like the way you just described the architecture of that you’ve got to basically have these are some facts about the Sun irrefutable. now here is how that affects the way we look at the world and exposes to us that we’re just ignorant we’re not awake to reality we can’t hold reality in our minds because it’s too vast to handle. I’m like it and I agree with you that you know what that wave laughter comes access to kind of deeper truths and I’ve heard some therapists in fact say that like that laughter is to shame what grief is to sadness. that laughter is helping to expel shame and to process shame. there’s something very important about people coming together and laughing together and I like to exist comedic Lee in a world where psy starts from a deeply personal perspective and admissions and acknowledgments of humiliation and shame and vulnerability and travels out to the universal and hopefully archetype although you can sort of travel between those points a comedian nothing we both admire Bill Hicks why I think is fascinating is because let you know like if you’ve loved Bill Hicks for a long while then you discover man that guy works material a lot! you know like you go I watched this interview of him on the Australian TV he’s doing like a bit that I’ve seen him do you know in multiple incarnations. but I have also seen him do interviews ways spontaneously talking about gigs terrible gigs have gone badly and he is hilarious. but it’s very interesting to me and perhaps it’s because of that background and that practice of doing clubs that Hicks is very much a comedian that’s no I’m drilling this fucking thing and I’m staying with it
[Joe Rogan]: you know he was a writer I mean he did ad lib but he did he was capable of going on these rants spontaneous rants but he was a writer you know he wrote these things out and he was aiming to have an impact with his commentary. I mean that was was was he was doing it was not just trying to make you laugh he was aiming to enhance your perspective on whatever he was talking about.
[INPUT]: yeah and as a it was seems very disciplined yes a practitioner of it whereas like say a Chappelle if it was like you’ve got an hour well
[Joe Rogan]: you know he’s got a very unique process Chapelle does and he can turn over an hour like no one I’ve ever seen before and I was talking to Donnell wrongs about it recently who you know was on the Chappelle show with them he’s like we both agreed like he’s the best ever at turning over a new hour he can have a new what he could release a Netflix special and then have a new hour within a couple of weeks. he doesn’t he makes sense I don’t I don’t understand how he’s doing it
[INPUT]: it must just fly in
"[Joe Rogan]: he’s just he’s in a great space you know he’s in a great mindset to do comedy you know if you pay attention to how you know when when people study like if you read outliers and you read how people when people study why people are great at what they do and what makes them exceptional, there’s always a variety of factors. and whatever the factors are with Dave he’s got this easygoing personality this like very carefully carefree way of looking at things. he’s also gone through a lot of bullshit in his career with you know the the leavings the Chappelle Show and you know abandoning fifty million dollars in going to Africa, and really understanding with it what his real motivation was. He was caught up in that world where they were trying to change him and commercialize his television show he handled it as good as anybody that’s ever handled it yeah he handled fame and temptation I think better than anyone I’ve ever heard of he just said fuck you and he just went away he went away and then didn’t do gigs for years. people understand he would show up and do stand-up places, but he wouldn’t book anything. so like he wasn’t getting paid. he was just he did stand-up Dave Chappelle did stand-up in the park in Seattle. he brought like a little amplifier and a microphone set up and just started doing stand-up and people just gathered round hmm and he did this just to sort of get him back in touch with his roots because he used to do a lot of street performing in New York and I saw him do street performing in Montreal we did a club and then we came out of the club and Dave I think Dave was like 18 or 19 just started doing stand-up on the street. and put his hat out and people would put money in his hat I mean he was constantly sharpening that sword. and he stopped doing stand-up for a long time in terms of like booking gigs. and then after a while I said fucking I’m gonna come back again. and then he started doing these gigantic gigs and then of course he did his two recent Netflix specials were amongst his best work ever and you know and now he’s working all the time he’s constantly popping into the Comedy Store in the Comedy Cellar and all these different clubs all across the country and constantly doing stand-up ya no social media does not not involved in any of that stuff doesn’t do anything just just performs just does this stuff."
[INPUT]: yeah that’s interesting. I feel that some people have like found the essence and found their path and live it. you like it and like that you know that the like they were a yogi or a priest or something. (that’s right) he’s just got a devotional this is Who I am I’m not doing anything there’s not that and it yeah that’s exhibited even in earlier stuff prior to the cry that over you know what you would do you know the crisis if the 50 million walk away thing like by then if he was at 18 doing them clubs he was hardened. he’s like you what that what seems so loose onstage was something that had been refined as a person who’s comfortable.
"[Joe Rogan]: he was always good he was good when I first met him when he was like 18 I think he was 18 I was 21 so was somewhere in that range. Maybe I was a little older maybe who’s maybe it’s like how old’s Dave 46 47 I think he’s five years younger than me. Is that correct? 46 or 47 45 okay so he’s more six years six years younger than me. so you know I was probably 25 and he was probably 18 ish 25 26 18 17 but he was he was so like calm. He was very… it was you’re attracted to listening to him. it was like like look at this guy like this guy’s like so comfortable in his own skin and so friendly and easygoing and hilarious but who he was then and then who he became is all the work that he put in. He had this base of this really you know this curious young very wise person who saw things that other people didn’t see in the world and then he just kept going. Then of course the Chappelle show which is in my opinion the greatest sketch comedy show of all time even though it was only two seasons it’s the best ever. and then after that I mean he’s basically just done stand-up and done it completely outside of this system he’s done up some parts of movies and shit like that, but for the most part what he’s doing is just stand-up. completely outside of the Hollywood system completely free. just goes up you know just talk some shit has a couple of drinks laughs and and and a and it’s incredibly compelling. he’s found his groove you know and that’s it’s a beautiful thing to watch as a fellow stand-up comedy practitioner when someone he treats Yves this mastery level like we know we were talking about with this Hicks and Gracey of stand-up comedy level because that’s where he’s at right now."
INPUT: Yeah I agree with you. become who you are yeah yeah he’s become himself
[Joe Rogan]: and he doesn’t have things that are getting in the way of that you know that’s what’s really interesting like you don’t see him he’s like he’s not on social media he’s not on anything Twitter or Facebook he’s not on any of that shit he doesn’t pay attention any of it he’s just just being a person just being a person and doing stand-up. you know it’s uh he doesn’t have to which is unique too. you know he doesn’t have to promote things they just sell out the end of
"[INPUT]: what an amazing example what an amazing example mm-hmm I’ve got promote some things so what do you go mentors I’ve really learned some powerful lessons there from the story of the apotheosis of comedy that Dave Chappelle’s achieved here’s these obligations now I’m booked here to promote Luminary. my podcast is gonna play a paywall on a platform called luminary aiming to be the Netflix of podcasts. meaning like that you know your model will I imagine triumphs further so like from like this week my podcast will be on luminary as part of their premium content. is an app through which you’ll get all podcast, but my podcast it’s like you’ve got says that launch now that’s launch cousin holidays yeah"
[Joe Rogan]: I know that was in the process of being created are you happy with that because it’s not lost …
INPUT: ? I don’t know you know you know you it like that you’re gonna leave listeners behind because it’s done behind a paywall but I spoke to sort of less Sam Harris about like what he Sam Harris actually told me about it and he – yeah right right and I spoke to like and what I recognized this because like the advertising model works here obviously in your case. I thought well like there it was like “it’s a good deal it was a good deal” I mean I can carry on doing podcast form two three years that’s what you know what this you know it’s and it’s support in a lot of other content and essentially not yielding any creative control of people just if people subscribe they get the premium content my stuff how it was like only at 5 bucks a month like that you get like Trevor no I’ll lean on mine (how many different partners?) I don’t I think like when they’re premium content. is like 40 or 50 premium pot good like you know pieces of content mm-hmm so for me I thought like you know it felt like otherwise podcast wouldn’t be something that I could continue to do forever every set you know art because I do films or TV shows or stand-up or whatever so like a different like you know it did for me it wasn’t a viable thing to pay for. in order to pay for people to run it. to pay for guests to even get to me and all of that good stuff you know know what should you do ads on your podcast live then I did before but nowadays it’s an ad-free model.
[Joe Rogan]: there’s a benefit to that for sure. you know a lot of people choose to go ad free and then they use patreon or something like that yeah they’re supported stuff Sam Harris was doing that for a long time but then he they had an issue with patreon about certain censorship of certain individuals and certain ideological perspectives where they were you know leaning towards left-wing things and you know being being restrictive towards right-wing things and then you know they policing the way people behaved outside of patreon and some people found that objectionable so he left and some other people left like Jordan Peterson left and ah I’ve never entered into Patreon that’s into those waters but I know bird does it I think burr has like one a week that he does doesn’t really yeah he’s one of the best.
[INPUT]: he’s so like but like I feel like yeah I feel like it’s an all right thing to do. but even in like just with using things like YouTube and social media and you know like Spotify iTunes whatever like you know as we have seen there’s a point where there is sort of censorship is a possibility. Like as you discussed on the Jacke like that run of episodes may as I said to you by text between the Jack Dorsey the reaction to that your response to the reaction through Alex Jones and all that simple I thought that was a spate of podcast that’s like this is where this medium can be. the Alex Jones podcast I thought was the godfather of podcasts.
[Joe Rogan]: We’ve seen the crook it was put it out tomorrow he just gave it to me so I yeah we have a guy who’s hilarious his name’s polytune. and polytune makes animated clips for us with podcasts and he’s fantastic I couldn’t he did one of the Alex Jones Eddie Bravo incident. yeah well they were there no not what he’s asking them to show from here (I went the flat earth?) enough no this one it’s so ridiculous here we’ll play it for you. I don’t hear what’s going on what’s the matter okay it was an exception if it looks like I’m here we go the guy does the awesome artwork do else
[INPUT]: we’re gonna give to this next and I respect you I want you guys to yell at each other for three minutes while I go pee I gotta pee too okay we’ll do in shit shit I’ll go first okay anyways
[INPUT]: you are someone that I could talk to about the flat earth conspiracy you don’t believe in Flat Earth but you can kind of understand where I’m coming from what if I financed a research ship and make a documentary I can’t go over three months I will pay one of them with money can you race we’re gonna need a are you guys going to the zoo or in orbit okay you raise the money go pee go pee man you’re gonna find the edge of the world film the drop off with my iPhone yes yes go pee man go pee don’t you have to gowe’re gonna send someone else the governor you really think
[INPUT]: there’s people out there campaigning for late term abortions you flame of course I believe that we went into a long conversation we played hurt it is so crazy that I always thought I was so tough doesn’t have to pee anymore the point is isn’t it why are we debating one of the earth is flat dude they’re keeping they have human-animal hybrids?END OF CLIP
[INPUT]: yeah yeah that’s good stuff. I feel like that is the pinnacle of where this medium can take us yeah watching like that’s like he was in an extreme state what about when he could go buy a be comfortable Kubla boy you be comfortable I never grease is like I listened to that podcast like I go on runs I’d listen to this fucking hell man where else are you gonna get this content? where is that guy… ?
[Joe Rogan]: well there’s no one would ever agree to it anywhere else that’s the thing you’d never get a group of people whose jobs depended upon keeping this show on the air. whether the producers are executives they would never agree to that they’d be like you can’t have that crazy fucker on! you can’t have this on you can’t have Eddie Bravo on all the time. you think Stump world is flat. stop this!
[INPUT]: you’re travelling between such a diverse and unusual ideas. and sort of the thing with Alex Jones as well is that he’s like he’s got it demonstrates to a point that there’s veracity in what he’s saying in some things.
"[Joe Rogan]: yeah he’s right about a lot of things you know we was talking about animal-human hybrids we started pulling up these studies they actually have done studies where they’ve tried to create animal-human hybrids. Non-viable Amaral animal human embryos, they’re trying to grow human organs in different animals and there’s all sorts of weird scientific shit though we’re doing imagine what they’re doing in China behind walls look at this"
[INPUT]: they used CRISPR to add to human genes into monkey genes and there’s like five monkeys this happened back in January and
[Joe Rogan]: his is a fucking horror movie this is a heart this is how the horror movie begins why did you think that once if that’s what’s being written
[INPUT]: the truth is darker yes for sure
[Joe Rogan]: for sure they’re trying to create super soldiers someone is trying to create some super soldier some half champ half human super intelligent murderous thing that’s powered by remote control.
[INPUT]: that is not a good objective no I don’t see a good outcome for this super intelligent murderous remote-controlled giant being
[Joe Rogan]: what if you could send those super intelligent murderous chimps to go kill Isis now now we’ve got a reason to snow getting out there now we need look we’ve got a nice contract with this defense contractor and they’re gonna
[INPUT]: that’s how we lubricate the passage to the murderous monkeys is Isis that’s the function of Isis in their cultural conversation is to justify the monkey soldiers
[Joe Rogan]: you know what one scared me more than anyone that I’ve ever read? I read about this thing that DARPA was putting together. so a robot called the eater robot EA TR robot it’s a robot that fuels itself on biological matter. so it essentially could eat bodies. so you’ve got a murderous robot that eats people.
[INPUT]: The worst kind of things that human beings could achieve it’s like people are sat around trying to come up with them
[Joe Rogan]: well they’re that you know the date they’re responsible for a lot of really crazy innovation in terms of like military stuff. Boston Dynamics you know they’re the ones that make those crazy robots and they work with DARPA and those are the ones that make those robots that you can’t kick over. all right you know I mean that’s what you need one of those that eats people and you send them to the battlefield. for you kick it over no that’s the first thing we established is you can’t kick it over I just think that’s that’s the big fear is that future warfare will be our robots versus their robots.
[INPUT]: if we’re starting to bring about the worst aspects that the worst things that a human being can conceive of this channel them through into reality it does make you fear that the apocalypse is here. I thought it was bad enough when in the malaise of my younger days I like for a while imagine if there was a cleaning service where the person will come around and clean dressed scantily. (they do that) whatever devious shit you can dream up someone’s trying to turn a buck off it and if they’ve taken it to the extent of the non kick over the robot flesh eating robots
[INPUT]: yeah a new video today watch this this is so scary this is Boston Dynamics yeah
[INPUT]: there’s something very eerie about that type of motion. you know that the way the movement of a snake is deeply coded to be unpleasant when you see it. they say maybe think that move me think that ain’t good the truck is telling Wow oh my god they’re polar truck) when it’s tiny little Tootsie’s knows that they’re that strong they get a truck come on a robot that’s a giant ass truck I mean he is also just a husky sled made out of expensive robots and a truck they’ve spent a lot of time and endeavor to go backwards I guess kinda but to an Asian Santa Claus they’re showing how strong these things are I don’t like I don’t like their gait Joe that’s an unpleasant gait y
[Joe Rogan]: yeah you should be on you should be uncomfortable with it. yeah that’s how I’m not easy at ease with that it’s not it’s not animal there’s no compassion in it this is it’s it’s feelingless but that’s what you got to worry about episode of black mirror or the lady gets chased down by the drones (I’ve not seen that why they’re one-way they’re bees?) no there’s a woman who’s being haunted she’s being hunted by a robot and it’s terrifying because if it’s remorseless lack of humanity and empathy looks just like that looks just like those things those real
[INPUT]: Holly Brooker he’s been to me that man’s could imagine that
"[Joe Rogan]: he’s amazing he’s amazing that show is fantastic but these things look what we have to worry about is once artificial intelligence become sentient, and you can somehow or another attach it to these objects that move, and they they run solar power or they have you know nuclear fuel cells or some crazy shit that allows them to exist for a long period of time. now you’d have to worry about them contaminating environments if your planet killing everybody in the environment."
"[INPUT]: also there’s no means of regulation is there? because this because this is the apex of human endeavor, they’re in what what can govern that? what can regulate it? and like you say there’ll be a Chinese equivalent for any of this stuff there’s nothing that’s above it going no is this a good idea? should we pull back? what it is you just pulled up a thing so they’re making that now you’ve got"
[INPUT]: that one I just showed you. there good hundred different models of it are going to be available starting production this summer
[Joe Rogan]: hmm doesn’t say how much they’re going well but available for people to buy well it’s a hundred different model says produce a hundred models that probably means it’ll produce a hundred of them mm-hmm like a hundred different companies are gonna want them but I bet it’s more than that yeah and spending about how much they cost
[INPUT]: it doesn’t say how much it’s gonna cost they’re gonna announce that later. They showed a robot arm coming oh that looks so crappy look at that thing imagine we have one of those things in the room filming we should get one no no way we come here
[Joe Rogan]: it’s got red eyes it’s like fuck you fuck you (what were the first ones to help be friendly just listening to us like Alexa)
"[INPUT]: that’s how it begins isn’t it yeah there’s something arachnoid ‘nearly about that it’s almost like you know that see if this tunes into the DMT component of what we’ve been talking about it’s almost as if we’ve already experienced this reality we’ve already been through the version where those evil insectoid robots take over so when we see on the screen we all know we’re doing that thing! we’re doing that thing where we create those things that bring about our destruction! and I believe it’s because we’ve become biased to commerce and a particular type of progress. but one narrative has succeeded because we necessarily have to throw off religion but you know at the dawn of the secular age because religion was becoming systems of bias and systems of oppression and whatever systems of what I want to say elevating certain types of power one supporting it at least. that’s good hang on a minute this religion and lot of it seems like bullshit! what we’ve done is we’ve abandoned the sacred. and I think if you abandon the sacred meaning there is more to life than what we can understand I listen to the Brian Cox episode and I’ve spoke to Brian Cox the British physicist astrophysicist on my show as well. and when he talks about like he said that you know we know that there’s not some additional component to a human being because we can break down everything that happens when you move an arm. you know whatever and I feel like we only have limited instruments. we only have limited instruments there’s certain frequencies that we simply cannot read. what else is going on when people are having these transcendent psychedelic experiences? we’re accessing elements of consciousness energies and frequencies that we are not able to access while we’re in this state. and everything we’re achieving and everything we’re building we’re building on this platform and the bias of this platform is towards pride progress and materialism. and I think the result is fleshy in robots and those evil monkey warrior soldiers we might want to calm down, and talk about what is we’re trying to design."
[Joe Rogan]: yeah I don’t know if I agree with Brian on that particular point that we think we know everything about where consciousness emanates. I don’t think that’s necessary but I like the fact that he thinks that way because he’s such a rigid hardliner for science. and yeah the guy works at CERN I mean he’s a brilliant brilliant man so of course he thinks yeah I also don’t think he’s ever had a DMT experience.
"[INPUT]: that’s right, I wonder that. yeah these some people I think give him a quick dose you know like because I as well I respect Brian and it’s further to my point similar to the hunting argument I can but you know I happen to believe in God.but like I when I talked to Brian Cox I got to the point where I’m saying all right even though I believe in God and you are an atheist that oh he said I don’t call myself an atheist what I felt like we both got to the point where we said compassion kindness and love are the most important things. in this way who cares?"
[Joe Rogan]: so when I say there when you say you believe in God do you believe in the traditional god of Christianity? do you believe in God it’s a concept? you have your own definition for it there
"[INPUT]: I believe that that state of oneness and transcendence that you’re talking about when you threw your DMT experiences that says you know love and kindness and love and awareness. I believe that is the most real thing. I think that preceded all matter. and I think that we that we can interact with it. so I don’t believe God in a sovereign just a guy away that the whole world is like an interactive by a biological living breathing goddess. I believe that we I believe yes that and that we can commune with it. Furthermore, the relevance of it for me is that it it suggests to me that we should be acting kindly and lovingly. and when we’re thinking about how do we organize our systems that our awareness of that energy accessible to all of us should be paramount in our understanding of how we organize. so like what I think is like that we should look at you know like we’ve been through as human beings in so many advents that agriculture technology industry thinking that we were that the you know the Sun went around there thinking that the earth was flat with all due respect to Eddie brother and we and before each of these realizations in each of these changes we always think we’re at the summit. we never know what’s gonna be the thing that’s going to change. my suspicion is that what’s going to change is that the way we relate to consciousness and the way we see ourselves as individuals. that we start having understanding that what the that becomes a priority that thing you described of like when I have come back from DMT trips I recognize this is just an illusion and it’s not real I think that will stuck like I believe that we need to prioritize that and progressing along that line. what are the implications of this not being the most real frequency there is how do we organize society on that basis how does that affect how we relate to one another what kind of how should we be governing how does that affect justice that that should be in the mix instead of how many fucking terrifying arachnoid weird gate robot motherfuckers can we you know like that’s the way we’re going the progressive technological route because it’s created medicine because it saves so many lives but it’s given this wonderful technology the spirit of entrepreneurialship but all of that energy it all gets pushed in one direction. you know it all goes that way. and I feel that we need to invite that back the sacred and the divine need to be back in the conversation"
"[Joe Rogan]: well there’s certainly going to be pros and cons with everything you know there’s definitely pros and with the creation of Technology I think of this I think of human beings as if you go back to single-celled organisms they have very little awareness of their environment. and then as it became primitive bugs you know as things evolved, they developed more awareness.but even us in comparison to certain animals certain aero animals have heightened senses of smell and survival instincts but they’re also color blind you know and they they don’t see things they see edge detection like that’s one of the things about deer. they see movement so like if you wear camouflage and you know your your pattern is broken up with a grid. and then you stay put. they don’t see you yeah they’re just it doesn’t mean it doesn’t register to them they see movement so we have a far more complex system of recognition than they do in terms of like visually the way we see things and I think that whatever skills or whatever sense is that we’ve evolved I don’t think that’s it. I don’t think that we’ve reached the pinnacle of it. and I think that as beings become more and more evolved they’ll probably gained more and more senses and that could be directly related to technology. it’s totally possible that what’s going on with technologies that we’re also developing through external means a way for us to see the world. a way for us to view like what they’ve done with the Large Hadron Collider is like the best example of it right. what they do with the Hubble Space Telescope and other telescopes you’re using technology to gain awareness and to see more things and that this is the good side of technologies that it’s allowing us to have a far greater understanding of all the variables that surround us. that we might not be able to detect with our senses. yes that this is a part of who we are and then I think when you’re talking about things like psychedelic experiences that’s probably another realm of understanding that we haven’t really achieved yet because we’re we’re still evolving as a species as a thing"
[INPUT]: what I think is interesting is that the continual bias along that technological path is towards profit you know when we see those the endpoint is always how do we make how do we maximize profit? there is no like the influence of how do we do what’s right. that’s like a sort of a purse like a sort of a general ethical what I wanna say sort of code is not being introduced there is no regulation like you know ultimately you know ultimately people will create the warrior monkeys or the most profitable machines. people because the the counter-argument isn’t being made no one is like what I’m saying no one’s making it there’s just there’s no union of you know there’s no clear opinion of hang on a minute where could we be going? no there is no body or ideology that’s able to oppose the relentless march of capitalism. I’m not sort of like a flat-out or capitalism is bad Here I am promoting a book using an iPhone or you know I mean I’m we’re all swimming in it. but what I’m saying is that if we acknowledge there are transcendent realms there there is information day and data that exists beyond what we’re able to receive of our senses. how are we going to incorporate that in the way we organize because otherwise the sort of the magnetism the pool the g-force of what’s most profitable what’s going to continue to suit the requirements of the powerful that will always the bias will always fall in that direction. and it seems like where that’s heading is certain kinds of ecological disaster certain kinds of economic inequality certain kinds of conflict you know and like we’re not one of the simple experiments that I apply is you know if we you know if we people say oh what’s wrong with the world world so fucked all this polarity I sometimes think well who is benefiting from how it is now? are there is anyone benefiting are there any groups institutions or individuals for whom this current state is beneficial? and if the answer to that question is yes then look at who those institutions are and they are most likely to a degree involved in establishing and maintaining these systems and there are you know institutions and individuals and organizations that this works just fine for
[Joe Rogan]: but are they just capitalizing on it or are they organizing it and there’s a normal part of the way human beings operate with this constant desire for innovation constant desire for improvement we always want to push further no no one’s comfortable where they are they will always want to be in a better place and this is almost like it’s built into capitalism I agree that this materialism which is built into capitalism also is what fuels innovation yeah because you want the newest iPhones so they have to design it and build it and make it all right and when new things come out like this new robot that apparently you’re gonna hundred models whatever that means what that is is this is they’re gonna sell it so there’s like it’s fueling innovation someone else will come along and compete with Boston Dynamics and then there will be there would be innovation wars. if these innovation wars weren’t in place right now our phones would look nothing like the iPhone 10 it just wouldn’t. we like to sx it would look like who knows what would look like? but there would be no no incentive for them to compete against all these samsung devices and huawei devices and all that stuff is fueling this innovation but it’s all being fueled by capitalism
[INPUT]: you’re quite right that the innovation is one of the benefits of the maintaining this system but it seems to me that we are excluding other factors. like that recur throughout human cultures we all have an idea of fairness of justice. and yeah I don’t want some clunky weird sort of Eastern Bloc phone made out of grey plastic. but like we have to I suppose examine as a society and as individuals what is important to us? there where I think you know we’ve talked touched several times upon you know the fact that as an individual you’re more likely to bias yourself towards negative information online. you know like we do have a degree of individual power and individual responsibility and I feel like if enough people awaken to the possibility of different narratives that the the capitalist idea of innovation and success and progress that all of these words can be examined what do you mean progress that assumes a teleology a purpose a destination if all time is happening at once if space is infinite like you know that bit of yours of like you know to try and fathom for a moment the limitlessness that we’re existing within then all these things are construct this is a construct and it is good to have technology but it’s possible to like at point times of crisis such as what it feels like we’re at now and although that people have said well we always feel that every generation thinks that they’re the one because they know their own impending death is coming and they narrative eyes that is something social and global regardless there’s gotta be a time where we start to introduce different ideas into our systems it seems like there’s room for that now because we do live in a truly global culture that there is the possibility for monoliths to introduce new innovation and there is nothing that can oppose it or regulate it. we’re starting to see this kind of breakdown. so I’m interested in how we can individually prepare ourselves to organize society differently to be over to overcome pretty superficial differences like are you go honey and I don’t go hunting we ain’t gives a fuck? they start talking about how we can organize the size where people who go on in or don’t go on in can live peacefully in different ways not entirely governed by a small cabal you know and I’m sure Platt power is more complex than that that seemed to be hugely biasing the direction of this so-called progress I think you answered your own previous questions when you’re talking about whether or not you can be spiritual and funny and like what are you doing can you carve that path out for yourself that what you’re doing there by
[Joe Rogan]: explaining that would influence people would give people a perspective that allows them to say yeah like why are we doing this and what is the purpose of this and if enough people hear those words and have that perspective introduced to them it’ll change the way they interact with the world and that changes the world it really does and that’s one of the more powerful things about discussions when someone like you says something like that and it resonates with people and they start thinking like why am i living like this like what if I only have if I really do only have 50 years to live why am i living these 50 years in some really unproductive bullshit way that’s not satisfying at all because I just want a bigger house? like what is it do I want a faster car? don’t want a expensive piece of jewelry? like what is what is the purpose of this path that I’m on now versus a path that I could be on? and what is the real conflict that we all experience between each other is it how much of it is due to a lack of communication how much of his due to a lack of real listening and understanding? one of things I’ve said about like comments and podcasts and stuff like that I think one of the reasons why a lot of people get mad and I’ve tried I think this through like why some people some of the response is so negative to things don’t it seem innocuous on the outside I think it’s because it’s frustrating when you don’t have a say yeah like a suit you and I are talking about something there’s probably some guy right now going well just fucking stop with all your spiritual bullshit here’s what you do you wake up when your fucking alarm clock goes off you never hit snooze you get out the door you put your hours in eventually you get better you take care of your family yeah act like a fucking man … and there’s probably people like that that are they’re upset they feel like we’re pontificating too much and this is all just you know just mental masturbation you’re right in ways it is but that’s part of how you dissolve these things and think these things through
[INPUT]: I believe they deserve their say yeah well and that’s one of the things that you know if being a person that goes to sort of 12-step support groups is you recognize that everyone’s individual experience that is valuable. yes so it’s not like that and I’ve got over the idea that that there’s some external thing can be imposed. and like you know whilst there like many people that are you know we could say not using their 50 years to maximum effect because they are you know pursuing odd material goals. there are you know many many more people that unknown introduced to the idea of freedom because from the moment they’re born they’re economically tyrannized. you told that you’re only if you are not economically valuable to this system you are not valuable at all and that isn’t that’s only an idea. but you know if you don’t know you know if you can’t become a lawyer or you know a comedian or whatever fuck you
[Joe Rogan]: well so many of us are trapped in the expectations and values of our parents too that’s a real problem with people don’t let their children become an individual. you know they force their children to follow their own rigid ideology shame them when they don’t
[INPUT]: I agree with that but do you not imagine that a fair degree of that stuff is unconscious do you agree probably unconsciously imposing things
[Joe Rogan]: on our 100% but not guilt and women if your kid comes to you and say daddy no I know you wanted me to be a doctor but fucking I want to play bongos I just want to be the best bongo player of all time I bet you’d probably like hey learn the fucking bozos give me a hug yeah go get those bongos get out there come the best BAM bang Goa you can there or even mediocre sure but there are fathers out there be like the fuck you are you’re gonna be a goddamn doctor stop being a pussy and you’re gonna go back to medical school and you’re gonna pick up your studies we want to get you a tutor and you’re gonna perform because we’re a Wilson this Wilson family’s been physicians since 1820. your grand time immemorial the Wilsons have been physicians he’s made people bite down on a leather strap before amnesia he sawed off legs and he kept those people alive. you want to play bongos you little fuck yeah people get mad
"[INPUT]: but my biases towards my kid like like so fine like when we was back in England like I was aware of like grandparents or whatever reacting spiders and stuff going our spiders are scary and then fucking teach him that spiders are scary I don’t want her to think of things as scary tell it like this spiders are cool they’re all right there’s nothing you know but I say and you’re aware of a familial influence like that they wanted the hair to be a certain way they wanted to wear certain things they wanted to hear like yeah part of the veganism is like if you make these kids vegan at least now I know wherever they go there’s gonna be so many restrictions on their food I’ve not made the kids vegan it’s up to them you know thank you where’s my gold stuff it’s my ticker tape parade and but like so but like you know I don’t know what you know we don’t know our own biases we don’t know what where we’ve been institutionalized you know because how you know the very nature of the unconscious is we are not aware of it you know so I suppose in a sense a continued open mindedness and a willingness to change must be part of any dialogue to go into these situations you know I might not actually know what that’s why I’m not when I was 20 if you’da said about their hunting I’d be like oh no man do I love Jesus there’s so many ways of seeing the world there’s so many ways of looking at what’s real and what’s correct I’m you know what I think with hunting hunting is like many things and that there’s no real clean answer there’s no yes or no good or bad because you could think there is but then you find circumstances like wild pigs or invasive species like I go hunting on a place called the nine it’s um one of the small islands of Hawaii mm-hmm there’s somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,000 people and 20,000 deer it is so overpopulated with deer hmm and they have to kill them to kill them every day they hire snipers they hire people killing people are slamming in with their cars I mean they’re fucking everywhere and their access deer they’re not even from there they’re from someone brought them over from India to give to King Kamehameha and like the 1800s they’re they’re animals actually that evolved to get away from Tigers so there’s this insanely fast beautiful deer that are"
[Joe Rogan]: everywhere they’re forced to kill well the good news is the people that are low income people of the island always have me there’s there’s meat everywhere everyone can hunt it’s really easy to find them you can you could find them and if you you know if you want you can go kill them
[INPUT]: yeah I’ve got no moral judgement about that you know if there’s rats in my house what I’m not gonna put down poison I’m gonna go up but that’s a thing that is allowed to get Larry you should
[Joe Rogan]: probably feel bad about killing a rat right
"[INPUT]: as a vegan I do feel bad everything I’m hungry what about yeah I wouldn’t I wouldn’t swap a mosquito even way even that llama even the Dalai Lama low I see him he went like the first time a gentle brash the second time a harder one, third time smack! the Dalai Lama like you know you Dalai Lama gives him free chances. you might be reincarnated as a bear can I go for the play yeah sure sure go ahead man it’s almost three o’clock already you believe it or not he said your"
[Joe Rogan]: character is neat he’s got these incredibly long rants you know but he’s so self-aware and introspective he’s they’re always analyzing himself trying to find if he’s doing right. I get a kick of these celebrity dudes doing jujitsu – I think it’s hilarious. it’s awesome it’s cool. it’s cool here I’m talking about it you tell you know the struggles with it. I just saw someone else said they just started it I can’t remember who it was someone famous yeah I might not be relevant at all but I’m trying to think Demi Lovato is like a purple belt or some shit. she’s been into it for a long time. Russell who you know I’ve trained with it Russell’s a legit blue belt I rolled with Russell and I was like wow Russell really knows jujitsu! he’s actually doing the right stuff here. it’s hard! it’s hard for someone to go from a place of where a guy like Russell Brand is. handsome beautiful famous man who has got some strange plumber sitting on his face yanking on his arm (his description of it is awesome) about feces in this bowels and yeah that veganism stuff’s for the birds though sorry vegan people to eat eggs if you don’t want to kill any animals please just find find a good farm that has pasture-raised eggs and see how much better you feel. or eat animals they’re assholes should find animals that are assholes in the woods only eat the assholes. somebody sent me this horrible video that I’ve seen many times before of a bear killing a deer in a backyard and a deer screaming the Bears tearing it apart I’m sure you’ve seen that before right? and he sent it to me and he goes okay now I get it. I thought like if a bear got a deer that it would be just oh hey this is just how nature works! like no this is a horrific violent act of this animal tearing this other animal apart now would you prefer that than a hunter because 99 times out of 100 when a hunter kills an animal it’s way quicker. there that’s the video it’s horrible! it’s a horrible video. this animal I think it’s actually a black bear I think it’s either a grizzly or a color phase black bear but it takes a long time to if you haven’t seen the video it’s a long one and the animal makes some horrible noises. we’re talking about returns talking about a video that I’ve seen before about this bear that kills this deer in this guy’s yard the guy films in the deers making these horrible noises. and this guy sent sent it to me and he goes “now I get it” because I get what the wild is actually all about because you don’t really see it that much you don’t really it’s very rare that you actually see an animal kill an animal so we have these romantic Disney find ideas of what the food chain looks like out there
[INPUT]: yeah nature’s brutal I mean I don’t try and impose on my dog the kind of conditions that I would hold myself to.
[Joe Rogan]: you should have an organic garden if you really want to do it right cuz if you’re getting into large-scale agriculture you’re buying food from people that grow it they’re running over fucking rabbits and mice and killing things with pesticides and there’s no there’s no removing yourself from death but just by eating vegetables it’s just you don’t they have to reap also they have to like when with large-scale agriculture there that ground all those animals get displaced yeah you know it fucks the whole ecosystem up whatever area they’re planting on and then when they roll over it with those gigantic combines and pull up that grain they’re chewing up everything! that’s why vultures always circle where combines are. as soon as they have fresh cut the vultures start showing up because they know there’s gonna be something that got jacked
[INPUT]: see once you know that that monoculture is unhealthy there are only resistance to or in it having not permaculture and the healthier better agricultural models is Commerce and profit that’s not ok
[Joe Rogan]: no no no your communes which you could have as a community gardens
[INPUT]: yes yes you could but the only real but like if you start if we start saying hey why don’t we not have monoculture anymore because it’s unfair and it’s unreasonable they go we can’t because it’s profitable to have it and people won’t be out forward food. but all of that is like it you know a city an interrelated system that sort of gridlocked into protecting itself. yeah you know like there’s a spiritual maxim wisdom is acting on knowledge and that is not the world we live in. we know things and then we just ignore it. you know like as individuals or as or as you know corporations and as groups. and like what I feel like I’m trying to do is an individual ways hold myself to that standard. it’s like I know that’s not good for me to do that anymore I’m not gonna do that I’m gonna do like I’m gonna watch myself and I’m gonna watch that behavior and I’m gonna try and improve. you know like I don’t want to go like when my first impulse in heading down today Ribeiro Jiu Jitsu plays I feel nervous. and I’m feel confident doing it I don’t want to go or whether it’s like giving up me or whatever but I’m doing these things in a sense I think these are the kind of improvements I can make. now like when you we almost don’t expect that of politic anymore. you don’t expect us of a political figure to say well listen monocultures I’m a terrible impact they’ll make some gestural thing wouldn’t let it go look we’re gonna try and control Facebook and Google a little bit. and we’re gonna try and reduce emissions this amount now let go listen we know that’s wrong we don’t do that anymore because there’s too many powerful interest! that’s why I was susceptible to the vegan documentary you know of course there’s the ethical reasons in my opinion for becoming vegan but because it’s like the reason that these kind of foods are promote it is because these powerful groups lobby government and Lobby the group the organizations that set the standards until they shut up and comply
[Joe Rogan]: you could sort of say that about vegetable based foods to power vegetables just corn just growing that’s the same that is the same you know like you’re saying that
[INPUT]: the reason that is continuing is because it’s profitable and but but these ideas aren’t going to get explored because we’re on one path one teleological journey like that sometimes what I feel like when people talk about the frets of different cultural influence eg Islam for example right but I feel like what we already live in a kind of fundamentalism that’s invisible to us because it’s all we know. we live in a culture that if something isn’t profitable it will not survive. and I don’t think that’s how human beings are set up to exist. I have this rather lovely anecdote
[Joe Rogan]: one of the things that happens is you’re in the woods and when that happens when the Sun Goes Down you can’t see where the fuck you’re going you have to have a headlamp how every hundred very far I have a really good one oh yeah I have a really good one
[INPUT]: lighting stuff up isn’t that gonna
[Joe Rogan]: well your don’t hunt at night right it’s illegal once the Sun Goes Down there’s no hunting you have to be able to see what you’re shooting out I shoot a person see some source it rolls lights on your header just to help you navigate through the woods and to spot predators because of course if you’re vulnerable. you know and you see giant eyes ahead that are 9 feet off the ground you’re like oh fuck it’s a bear! it’s a two-way street yeah that happens I’ve had experiences where I’ve ran into predators in the wild. particularly one time in Canada I ran into a grizzly bear. and looking in the eyes and wasn’t even a big one it was like a 6-foot bear wasn’t huge but it looks right through you. it looks right through you and so when you run into an animal that’s killing shit every day and it looks at here’s I got demonic-looking it’s honest I’ve meat I’ve seen black bears before you don’t see that look. Grizzly bear which is you know more predatory they have a crazy look in their eyes it’s really interesting
[INPUT]: I made eye contact with a couple of predators a shark once in a shark cage on like when I was doing that film Sarah Marshall that done years ago yeah well when in a shark cage and right and they lower you down and you see a shape a shark come toward you it’s like it’s swimming through time it’s like it’s come from another ear it looks at you would like you think oh fuck you know and like and I was terrified in that cage. and like like Ed Norton was there and with the Olson they were on that island as well they were mates with people that were on the movie they go in the water outside of the cage. bother other fucking mind that’s insane is near this shark was little when apparently it’s not kind of shot easy but even the eye contact then it’s fucking teeth I don’t even look it and then another thing I looked at once I was in a tiger sanctuary in India. and I like I didn’t like the vehicle I was in. there’s a Jeep over there so I got out of it to transition and my mate goes you more getting a corner might just fucking Tiger over there! and it was a tiger like only 10 foot away. and maybe I’m exaggerating on a 20-foot maximum like if it was near and the way that that thing I mean it cuz it’s so beautiful as well the intensity of being looked at by that fucking creature there’s some powerful shit you don’t want iContact without I don’t want to look at something that’s got like that you can’t negotiate with. you can’t I feel look at me even with the jiu-jitsu like I’ve got that little moment where I go ray come on we sell Russ yeah with a I go she doesn’t care about your mortgage. yeah neither does that grizzly bear doesn’t care they look through you kids
[Joe Rogan]: yeah they don’t care it’s just but that’s all it’s doing all day long it’s a killing thing it’s unbelievable
[INPUT]: cuz that’s as true as everything we are effect on it just to ask please
"[Joe Rogan]: don’t know what that is so their idea of what the wild is is really based on two things once they’re their actual love of animals they know right it’s like dogs and cats so the animals that we know we as we we have this connection with them so we think that these are animals. They’re science projects man those are not animals real animals don’t give a fuck about you! they in either indifferent to you or they’re scared of you or they want to eat you. that’s real animals the relationship that you have with a dog is like a child like my dog is more like a child to me than he is like an animal. I mean he’s like my little friend that doesn’t get to speak. he doesn’t talk but you know an animal in the wild is a competing organism they’re competing amongst all the various organisms in whatever ecosystem they’re in and either they’re at the top or they’re somewhere below that. and that’s just how it goes and every deer is looking around cuz there’s cats and the cats are slowly sneaking up on them every fucking day of the week. and if you go in a place where there’s deer you best believe there’s gonna be mountain lions there because that’s how it operates! and when you see that in the water it’s so rare it’s so rare to be around that but when you see that in the wild then you get a deeper understanding of what it means to be an animal. yeah what’s horrific is factory farming what’s perverse and disgusting is the way animals are treated when these livestock companies pump these animals in these warehouses and make them stand in their own shit all day and then abuse them, and the horrific nature in which they’re raised yeah all that should be illegal. yeah gag laws those laws where whistleblowers get arrested those should be illegal those are immoral! they’re letting people know what goes into your food and those people are being punished for that all that shit is grant they’re being punished because it hurts business yes well it should fucking hurt business you’re doing something that we all think is immoral that’s how I feel about it I don’t think there’s anything wrong with even if they if if there should be standards and how cows are raised how chickens are raised let them live like actual cows. (that’s beautiful) and there’s a way that they can do that where people like Chris Pratt yeah from guardians got a great guy he has he raised his sheep and he eats them and he even gives them out to people he has butchers that take care of it. these sheep are treated like like they’re loved they’re not scared of people and then literally they get walked into this room they have no idea what’s gonna happen a bolt gets put on the top of their head bang and the lights go out. now you could say that should never happen and those sheep should just live forever. okay you could I could understand that argument. or you could say boy if you’re going to eat meat and you’re going to eat the meat of an animal that you know how it lived and there was no horrific moments in its life, it’s just one day the lights went out that seems like the best most ethical way to do it maybe even perhaps more ethical than hunting. yes because when I’m hunting an animal it’s you know it’s out there in this this crazy state where it’s always looking to get eaten these sheep have no idea they can be eaten. they think that everybody is their buddy, and then one day they die."
[INPUT]: yeah man I agree with that you know yeah there’s it’s difficult to bring ethics to that that’s clearly in my view a matter of opinion some people think that’s okay but
[Joe Rogan]: someone it’ll say they get turned around on me and say you could do that same like thought experience with people like why don’t you just see people well okay the person live a perfect life you put a bolt in the top of their head and bang shut the lights out and then they turn it to barbecue
"[INPUT]: look yeah that’s a very pronounced and vivid way but I would say that in a sense we’re all like we’re being commodified imprisoned in clothes you might like the very fact that a law has been made to prevent people regulate in or revealing the truth around that revealing showing shows where the true bias of this system is. in a way I think that one of the cultural jobs this podcast has performed and this is like whether deliberately or not is it demonstrates that the old political lines that we used to comfortably abide within a starting to sort of break down. because you know like something like an obvious signifier of a particular type of person ie I go hunting now we have to accept is coupled with your view that the agricultural industry needs to be regulated and it’s disgusting now there are you know there we have complete and total agreement, and we both can see that the way that legislation is set up is biased towards corporate interest commercial interests and profit. yeah and so for me weather you know Chris pet privately owned sheep I think you know problem man well that’s not I don’t need to spend my time worried about that I’m a little bit like Alex Jones like with the why we worrying about flat earth they’ve got them babies and all of that stuff? it’s like why don’t we focus on the things that are making a genuine difference to the way people are living lives? yeah and it seems to me that one of the priorities is in a new global landscape that we’re living with what are the dominant forces and what are the goals of the dominant forces? and how detached those goals from the lives of what you might say are ordinary people or the majority of people to use it less in a complex term?"
[Joe Rogan]: and what’s probably most horrific about reforming the system is that the people that are going to suffer the most of the people that are the poorest so if you think of like fast food in particular right there’s a lot of like really poor people that rely on fast food because it’s very inexpensive. if you go and you can get a lot of calories for a small amount of money right? but if you go from the fast food restaurant and then you go down the line to factory farming and then somehow no they eliminate factory farming and they say no no if you’re gonna raise animals you have to have the same sort of standards that we would expect if we knew you if we were there we want pastures we want animals living in the wild we were you know fenced in but like living like an actual animal. not this crazy warehouse bullshit you guys are running. well that’s gonna up our operation cost well then that’s how it’s gonna be so then the beef becomes far more expensive. now the beef becomes far more expensive than what a fast food what are the restaurants do? well they’re gonna have to make things more expensive – so who’s gonna suffer? the poor people who’s gonna suffer with cheap meat in supermarkets? poor people that can’t afford it no but I think what happens
[INPUT]: Joe is you start to put you have started to pull a thread that reveals the how the fabric of our culture is corrupted because it shouldn’t be more expensive the only reason it’s more expensive is because everything is put into a capital based ideology we’re already I’ve heard many times on the show you discuss in universal basic income this is that the beginning of looking at alternative economic models. and there’s an argument for saying everyone has the right to a nutritious deiet everyone has the right to a safe home you know so like you know if we start prioritizing those ideas above these organizations have the right to maximize profit on the sake then maximizing profit that’s getting taken off the table and then there comes your counter-argument about innovation well I would say if innovation slows no problem because we are we’ve decided as a culture to prioritize housing and nutrition for the majority of people. now you can say that starts – you know that’s that’s kind of socialism. but and I don’t think that that can work on us on a continental scale I think you have that we have to break down centralized systems whether those are corporate centralized systems or national. I feel that we the time is gone where there’s too much diversity like them not – they probably always was diversity people are different we were influenced by our culture’s our schools our education our class our races all these factors and then to expect us all to live in this sort of single bandwidth of this is what America is all this is what France is all this is what England is people are too different now but what you know if it does it seems like the standards we were adhering to unconsciously or otherwise is these groups have the right to make as much money as they can and to interfere with that is un-American or un-British or whatever it was you know beyond national ideas I’m sure so you know for me that’s the you pull that Fredo it’s the poor that will suffer well then no we have to rule out the poor suffer so we have so what happens in the end you start to get into redistribution of resources managing and regulating the power of the most powerful people and whenever that conversation start it gets shut down because we conserve
[Joe Rogan]: even in a capitalist system wouldn’t it be more ethical if everybody started from the same starting block well that’s what’s wrong with the world right what’s wrong with the world is some people are in a they have a terrible hand of cards they’ve been dealt. My point about food is that the people that are gonna sir they’re gonna suffer the most are the people that rely on the cheap food yes you’ll soon as that cheap thing gets pulled away then a lot of those supermarkets and a lot of those fast food stores that rely on that factory farm food you know they’re gonna be in a bad situation. things are gonna be much more expensive. and if things are much more if they make animals live like what is that guy’s name? Polyface farms Joel Salatin? He’s a fascinating cat I had him on my podcast before he’s sort of a farm reformist and what he believes is that these animals should live just like animals when he has pigs he puts them in a fenced area but he moves the fenced area every day so like the pigs move to a different spot. and so they’re just constantly foraging and eating acorns and but they’re you know they’re living like a pig. they’re living in a naturally they’re not living in some crazy warehouse yes it does same with his chickens he has this mobile chicken coop but he moves it from pasture to pasture and this is how he operates his entire farm
"[INPUT]: yes it seems again the point that’s been we’ve talked about earlier that we ought to like if we look at no one knows what’s right. so perhaps what we could try and do is replicate what we do naturally. and so there is an argument that naturally we do hunt there is an argument that naturally we do eat meat there is an absolutely Grob food to them right it’s an argument that it’s always saying like getting into organic gardening if you have your own garden man I mean that is like one of those Karma free things ever if you can figure out a way to have your own compost your own garden and you don’t ever have to rely on anybody else for your food, well then you’re not participating in that shit at all"
[INPUT]: do you think that the spirit of entrepreneurship could be turned to designing these systems do you think the only thing that incentivizes people is maximum profit I I do too I think that is possible that people would sit around go how do we organize a society that’s fairer and just that doesn’t kill people’s individualism or creativity or right to pursue different goals or to be who they are and believe who you know but like I feel like there’s so much fog in the air people don’t know what they actually believe in because there’s so much powerful cultural influence. so much toxin physical toxin literal toxins and toxicity cultural toxicity! you know how are how am I to protect my children from cultural influences that tillens you have to look this way be this way behave that way these are the things that call if you’re not this you’re not a man if you’re not this you’re not a woman you know like what like you know as a parent I feel the obligation to create an environment where they can grow up to be who they are in inverted commas and then when you sort of scaled it up to a society you know how can we start to recognize look is this time to look at different systems for living and I what I feel is people want to be involved in their in the power systems that affect them like if you have a group of a hundred people they want a bit better to run their own schools around their own care systems from being charter their own life not just be some little beam of energy flicked about by cultural forces that they can’t reach or touch it’s alienatig n and like one of the things in Marxism and that you know very little about this subject is he says that when capitalism reaches a certain point people will be lost alienated they’ll feel like a cog in a machine no one will have no pride in their work no will know what it’s like to make a whole bicycle and think look I made that you’re just you’re the guy that makes the pedals now fuck off home you know now like you know like I’ve listened to enough Jordan Peterson to understand that there are limitations to what socialism and Marxism can achieve but just because you know capitalism is better than feudalism that doesn’t mean that’s the end of the conversation that we shouldn’t be looking for fairer better more just ways of living
"[Joe Rogan]: well yeah I don’t know of capitalism as the problems but maybe it’s how people engage with capitalism maybe it’s what people choose to focus on. if you’re just about acquiring wealth and money some people are yeah they’re gonna be very deeply unhappy. it’s gonna be this weird game of acquiring influence and power too you just have this insurmountable mound of money that you live on top of. I don’t think that’s a good way for them either. I think if we’re gonna really we’re going to look at this country fairly we have to look at think of all the poor neighborhoods and imagine being born in those poor neighborhoods and imagine being born in a place where there’s no resources, there’s no hell you’re living in the fucking mountains of West Virginia those coal mining communities, or people it’s all just mobile homes and pills and it’s chaos and but just extreme poverty. what do you do if you’re stuck in that? what have you if you’re born into that clan ?that’s the group you’re born into you’re fucked man you’re fucked. we have to take our resources and concentrate on parts of America the same way we concentrate on many other problem spots in the world and look at them as like hey man there’s a spot where people are fucked and we should unfuck them we should figure out a way to go into every single horrible community in this country on this planet ones that are just as bad as something that you see in third-world countries they exist right here in America fix that. don’t ignore that. that’s crazy! though if they’re in Detroit if they’re in wherever the fuck they are whatever whatever the horrible community is why isn’t there a concerted national effort to eliminate that that’s a major source of crime it’s a major source of people feel like they got fucked over in life so they want to get at you and take from you because you got that easy road hey man you’re born in the fucking suburbs hey man your mom and dad are still together you know hey man your dad has a job and your mom’s at home baking it shit you live like a motherfucking Norman Rockwell movie fuck you man! my mom’s on crack my mom’s a prostitute my life is hell my dad beats me I’ve been sexually molested since I was a little kid! this is the reality that people exist and they don’t feel like anybody’s coming to help them! we need to concentrate on that the government if the government really cares about us if they’re really involved in social engineering and making America better again make those places better. those are the places you need to concentrate on not tax breaks for fucking super-rich corporations that get you in place then they make enough money man that’s not the problem the money is where where the money goes what’s it being allocated towards the biggest problem in our country is he’s in impossible to escape communities. yes that so many people just get sucked into this trap and for every person that gets out and becomes a basketball player or a successful business person and they have this story about the poverty that they grew up and they they are so rare yes and then it’s not to be applauded that they got through that it is but it’s more to be we should understand like hey I’ve got a real fucking problem that we’re churning out all these people that live with what they start out in life with a massive deficit start out in life emotionally fuck physically abused. they start out with everybody around them – loser everybody’s going to jail. everybody is constantly doing pills or this or that they’re it’s all negative. and to do to ask them to develop their own positive mindset uniquely in a vacuum it’s preposterous yes oh I’ll just pull them up by your bootstraps. all those assholes hey you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps like they don’t even have boots man you don’t understand like you don’t know what you’re talking about you’ve never seen it you’ve never been involved in that kind of poverty he’s not fair it’s not fair it on if we care about people that’s we should fucking care about yes I couldn’t agree more no problem and it’s everywhere in the world all the Paul the crime and poverty will imagine if everyone the lowest you could live is like a middle class existence. boy everybody would all be a lot more fucking relaxed! if you always had meals you always had food you always had a roof over your head everyone lives middle-class holy shit! I mean obviously that’s way past the expectations that we have right now for the world because like 34 thousand dollars a year globally puts you in the world 1% you know I mean that’s the what make $34,000 a year which is hard to live on man. yes you you’re in the 1% of the world"
"[INPUT]: but that standard that you very eloquently described is I think achievable yeah what be the aim and when you give just one example of how legislate the bias legislation is continually to support the powerful while making the just making nominal gestures to poverty we’re putting in yeah yeah and like so if there is a point to nation if there is a point to a flag and our belief and this idea that there is an America and there is a Britain and we’re all together we’re all one and we’ve got a common destiny in a common past, then if we’re not if we’re ignoring and neglect in those communities then I say that is what defines us. you know and until there are system,s codes, regulations that prioritize that we will continue to live in something heading to what if not a dystopia something moving in the direction of dystopia where their priorities and dreams are sort of owned really by the kind of bit mad evil insect robot images that Wilson discussed that"
[Joe Rogan]: people do get very concerned when someone reaches a point of excessive power and influence like a Jeff Bezos type character. when you see some guy who’s not he doesn’t have a million dollars like oh wow guys got a million dollars like he must be so relaxed! that’s so much money. now he’s got a hundred and fifty billion and he works every day maniacally. He’s constantly doing new projects and new things and buying out Whole Foods and that’s like pinnacle capitalism it’s one of the things that scares people the most when someone just acquires just insane position of power and wealth. like like a Bill Gates type character who is very altruistic very very generous Bill Gates’s he’s are one of the better examples of someone who gains a lot of money and then does a lot to help people especially in his retirement all they do is focus on charitable organizations and
[INPUT]: yeah which is brilliant I mean a marvelous and you know I’m not criticizing the great achievement of brilliant people but it like it really for me that demonstrates the limit that the limitations come from the type of system as we live in that you can’t through charity affect every impoverished community in America. you know like we the systems that we have are oh well if you’re poor like that you know the bootstrap model well this guy did it look at this great I overcame the odds? you know until like I feel like in a sense charities become kind of valve that allows you know people like you and I who aren’t poor to feel like well I do a bit you know I’m sort of involved I can wash my hands of it. Unless we there’s no reason no America there is no England unless we have integral relationships with one another we support one another
[Joe Rogan]: if we really are on a team when we see someone who’s completely downtrodden who’s on our team and we ignored them well that’s not much of a fucking team is it? no I mean that’s what I feel like when I come to red lights and I see homeless people I feel terrible. I’m like I feel like you know I mean there’s part of you is like don’t give them any money because they know they’re gonna just buy drugs you know let them figure it out! but then they’re not gonna figure it out they have mental health issues. and they’re and they’re supposedly on the team they probably born in America they probably have national citizenship here you know they this is our team and no one gives a fuck they’re camped out under the bridge. it’s like the the diffusion of responsibility that comes with these massive numbers 20 million in LA 300 and plus whatever it is now was like 320 in America
"[INPUT]: yeah it’s unbelievable I think there’s 90,000 in there general California like a cities worth of homeless people isn’t it it’s not difficult for me to envisage that when we talk about the transcendent states that can be achieved through meditation and psychedelics meaning that beings like us can access them. it’s not difficult to envisage human like a type of creature a type of being a little more evolved than us that would look back and say “oh my god they allowed homelessness they allowed those impoverished communities” or why was it oxide this belief in competitive systems and survival of the fittest that were resourced from ideas that weren’t really meant to be translated into that when you were talking before about like the natural world is fraught with competition and fret of course is that he’s animal so you know I’m not disputing what you’re saying there but we can’t transpose that into an economic system survival of the fittest if you ain’t got enough hustle and muscle fuck you you’re you’re down by the wayside you know here we have an obligation to aspire to the better parts of our nature not to continually use materialism and rationalism to justify that 20% of the population you know whatever vicinity is a just garbage are just waste and they’re that’s affordable we can a court we can live with that. is it for me it’s that why would we one we have the knowledge that oh yeah we shouldn’t be farming in that way oh we shouldn’t have social systems all of the answers always the same. If you were to change in that area it will affect the interest of the powerful it will affect impede the ability of certain organizations to make profit. now I’m near I’m not talking about here I don’t know the lexicon enough around socialism and capitalism and Marxism various forms of social organization I’m just talking about my assumption that we’re all resourced from the same basic material and phenomena. we all have compassion and love in us and if we on an individual level can achieve some level of access to that, then we can start to organize ourselves on that basis not on the basis of well what’s the most I can get an individual it’s rational for me to I’m not involved in that that doesn’t affect me personally. you know and I think it’s a hard thing for us to hold I think the reason we all do just live with homelessness and the only decision we make is do we put a couple of dollars out the window with the light or not then like it’s hard to hold that it’s hard there’s a lot more than 100 people"
[Joe Rogan]: there’s no fix like there’s no that’s an individual but not as not one person and even collectively as a group when you have mental health issues unless you want to institutionalize those people yeah but then who here’s the thing. If everyone has a unique and if everyone has their own ideas about what to do with their life and everyone has freedom what if you just don’t have enough people that are interested in in mental health of the homeless people? you just don’t have enough.
"[INPUT]: there’s no resources guarantee results yeah that’s a big question because our systems are biased in a particular directions money whether they have government funding do you think that they could cure homelessness one of the advantages I’ve got of being a drug addict is it means I have to help up a drug addicts as part of my own recovery this puts me into areas institutions groups facilities where I’m meeting drug addicts and always what you’ll find the people that were there is always someone like a man or woman most often in my personal experience is a woman some matriarchal woman full of mother energy that just will do this shit forever for free for nothing that just loves it let’s just put herself like my grandmother did or my mother did or like these women do between people and the gutter. they’re just wind say I’ll be the person I’ll be the person in LA at friendly house it was a woman called Peggy Albrecht it used to run a play a friendly house was over for women that have got drug and addiction and abuse issues. and like this woman she was from Chicago she was 90 years old by the time like I met him so rude and brilliant and beautiful and entirely willing to dedicate herself. and I think every community everywhere everyone knows people like that. and I feel like the same way as like if it is someone that has got a great capacity to play basketball or be a comic like I think that when you spot those people that you encourage them talented people yeah the talent of compassion and you know but we don’t value that unless it’s like unless it could be turned to a profit fuck off all of those organizations like those organizations that help people with addiction issues you know they are maligned. and like the people that profit from the opioid crisis they are supported they are able to conceal as john oliver brilliantly revealed or they’re able to conceal their practices. continually the the invisible bias is in the direction of profit and like the failure of certain types of socialism doesn’t mean that’s the end of the argument. i think we have an obligation to look for ways of accessing our own higher nature better nature kinder nature, call it what you will—and seeing how we can organize that as an individual you can do so much even if Bill Gates can you know fucking no cure malaria and make the significant charitable day no these impressive powerful people can’t make a meaningful difference then clearly this is a systemic problem"
[Joe Rogan]: well there’s also the problem with homeless people and that they’re adults when you become an adult. and you develop from the time your child it’s probably very likely that the damage was all done while they were young. they’re probably abused and neglected and there’s a lot of issues that led them to either have mental health problems or they had mental health problems already maybe they have genetic problems then on top of that there’s drug abuse. For each one of those people to get well you’re gonna need a massive amount of folks you’re not gonna have one old lady who’s rude people who would be the woman I woul like the one that was out of golden girls Estelle Getty she’s been available Oh God Betty white still hanging in there yeah well would you book a movie around her stay
[INPUT]: how are we gonna fund this? yeah it’s um there’s limitations to the individual but there’s
[Joe Rogan]: not like crash this optimism in the crib now Joe because I’m joshing the optimism but I’m saying the logistics of it would almost be insurmountable and it’s very is not an objective thing it’s this thing that’s been biased over time sort of once a person is developed once there are a human it’s very difficult to turn that train around. yeah if we can save the community and save the future like help like less people get through fucked help let help more people get through with hope and with a real possibility for improving their life versus have this sense of hopelessness that many are confronted with that’s gonna make less crime I agree that’s like that’s just if someone looked at it from a social engineering standpoint it almost seems like they will the only way that would ever have to happen would be there’s be some fucking catastrophe that forced people to act. we sometimes need something that’s shoved in our face to force us to act but if someone brilliantly calculated the amount of resources that it would require and then also brilliantly calculated how much less crime we would have how much less how many more innovations because people didn’t waste their lives in fact they got through life and used one of the most valuable resources we have which is the human imagination and creativity and ingenuity like and we’re missing that on these people that are growing up in these horrible environments where they can’t escape. they’re so fucked from they’re in gangs they’re you know the crime and poverty and violence. they’re so fucked that whatever genius they have is wasted on this nonsensical existence. if they could just show that and quantify how much that would be how valuable that would be to the overall culture and community of the cause of the continent and ultimately of the earth. you would have a reason to engineer and think about this
[INPUT]: yeah it’s a beautiful that is really beautiful and it’s interesting that the way that I agree with you that it’s almost has to at some point be translated into monetary value because otherwise people don’t seem to read it
[Joe Rogan]: yeah and safety for everybody for them who live in these horrible communities wouldn’t be great again if everybody lived like a middle-class person the idea that that’s impossible seems so insane it’s almost seems like well then nobody should live like that then like either everybody should be able to live like that or nobody should be like that was like that’s what everybody really wants right you want to be comfortable like in terms of like your ability to exist. and then all the things you’re doing that you struggle with should be a good percentage of them other than emotional and friendship type things should be of your own choosing you choose to take a difficult path. you should choose to take an adventure. you choose to try to enrich yourself with this difficult experience and the challenge of it and try to overcome that challenge. instead of you your challenge is not to get killed by a gang. you know your challenge does not get fucked by your uncle again. you know what I mean? I mean this is what people have to deal with and you’re you’re missing these brilliant minds they don’t get this chance to come through and and sneak through that fucking Salmon Ladder you know get up to the top!
[INPUT]: this is very beautiful that you’re passionate about this and I think popularizing these ideas is important because I feel that then people will be familiar with this kind of language and will recognize that when there is political discourse how fatik and empty is that people will say you know like I think in the last election in your country it was clear that there was no one no one is saying that no one no one is standing on a political platform of do you know what everyone should basically be I live a middle-class lifestyle there’s no reason there’s enough resources we can do this we could organize society on that basis because that’s considered outlandish and you’re crazy. and we’re so there’s so much I can again you know with your imaginary listener that would consider this pontification you know there’s so much anger I can I feel that a lot o political events that have occurred in the last five years or the manifestation of a social rage of people that are pissed off with not being heard and a pissed off with a cultural conversation that didn’t include them and that they feel angry like I want to help other people fuck knows but you know that if that resource is becoming so nurtured and grown and I feel people would feel tremendous relief to let go of that. just to feel like listen it’s alright for you to be you could we be a little more aspirational? and a little and consider what our goals are consider what progress looks like to us is progress the terrifying robots or is progress considering elevate in the lowest among us to raise the standards
[Joe Rogan]: people could just understand that this this is not forever you don’t there is no such things forever this is a temporary thing you’ve got to try to eat as much good out of this as you can and to go against my point you know there’s a real problem with people being lazy. people are lazy there’s not an equality of effort the idea of equality of outcome like people want you know income equality well there’s no effort equality. that’s just the fact there’s people out there that are just they work harder they’re smarter they’re more focused they’re less distracted they’re more dedicated they have a better plan they’ve got it through better and they become more successful and the idea that they become more successful than you because somehow or another there’s some nefarious actions afoot well that that negates another possibility which is you’re a lazy cunt that’s a possibility yes and what do we do about those people? I tell you this I’ve got a plan for the lazy
[INPUT]: lazy Island Pinocchio’s donkey laugh no arcade games though they’re too lazy I feel like I’m well I consider this that people that don’t have a lot of life force like yeah I feel that it’s a gift to be a person that’s got a lot of Drive to be a person that’s like I’m fucking going to achieve this shit you know like that some people are a little lethargic and don’t have a lot of energy I feel that’s a kind of despondency we could break that down in a thousand different ways is it poor diet is it poor role models is it poor social conditioning who are these lazy people weak genius could be weak Jews even weak genes okay then we’d like in the territory of disability so however you look at it? I think you end up at a point of compassion I think if you say I think we should start at the point of compassion. because now they’re all like what is tolerance if it isn’t the tolerance of people that w sort of can’t understand
[Joe Rogan]: as long as the carry their own weight we usually don’t have a problem with it but when they’re so lazy they just Juke the system and screw people over and figure their way to scam through life
[INPUT]: yeah but I think those people don’t exist only at the bottom of the social ladder I think they exist at the top and the effect there is were so he’s all about the president in those two this is my country motherfucker you better be
[INPUT]: found him to be delightful you know so very so sweet again like I say I don’t judge me there wasn’t I interviewed him about five years ago I was doing salsa for he was the pretty was okay let me near him on the wall like like he um yeah he was sort of sweep I remember thinking why I felt was why you don’t have no intellectual curiosity that’s what I felt well that’s why I felt I felt like I was sort of like him he was nice and his staff at that big Tower they all loved him. but maybe just curiosity and I don’t think he’s been very genuine with that great make America great again for you I don’t ladies where’s that everyone shall be middle class we’re gonna start reorganizing Society reaching out into Detroit and in a crushed mining towns in West Virginia where’s that other than wise you ain’t making America great again
[Joe Rogan]: that’s true that’s true but think about how we were talking about Dave Chappelle but one of the reasons why he’s so great other than the fact that he’s smart mmm just talented and all these good things is that he knows what he does and he does it. that’s his wheelhouse he stays in there trumps wheelhouse is making giant gold buildings with his name on it. and spray-tan he knows what the fuck to do and he knows how to make money. and he doesn’t give a fuck about all that other stuff cuz that other stuff is wasted energy for him his energy is in focusing on how you get more buildings with those giant gold Trump letters on it
[INPUT]: no one can argue that it’s been a tremendous success lately one of those hotels the water bottle had his face on it you know mean he’s amazing incredible achievement drinking if you be inside of his face
[Joe Rogan]: but that’s his thing right it’s like why is it okay for your thing to be tennis and that’s all you know about I don’t even pay attention to the politics why is that okay but when we see a guy like him we have a problem with it because he’s his intellectual curiosity is only about money so it’s even grosser
[INPUT]: I agree listen the show are to return to my point I wouldn’t waste time judging anyone as an individual because I imagine if I were to spend time examining Donald Trump’s past his relationship with his father the conditions he grew up in what we felt we had to do to be a good person I would imagine our Cokie of course but what I would query is the system that elevates the people like that and I you know the incredible power like and you know again I believe in it systems that need to change no individuals I think we’ve overly fetishized politics. I don’t live in this country so I don’t know if it’s much worse under Trump I’ve heard some things that sound really bad or then it was under Barack Obama but hat my general belief is you have indeed don’t fetishize individuals and get distracted to think about changing the system because you were not getting that middle class lifestyle for everyone naive no one’s offering that Bernie Sanders isn’t offering that no one’s offering about and unless someone’s offering that what’s the where while should we get involved
[Joe Rogan]: have you ever talked to economists about like what is the problem what’s the feel like people that are you know more socialistic minded they’d be more socialist minded I guess but but understanding of capitalism to the point where they could point out the flaws in allowing this infinite growth model where someone gets to a point like a Jeff Bezos or something like that what would they do to mitigate that? you’re not gonna put a cap. like let’s when people say that like you’re gonna pay 70% in taxes over ten million dollars I was like one of the ones that was banded about people just start laughing. like you’re out of your fucking mind! no one’s gonna do that. they’ll get to ten million dollars and then they’ll stop yeah it’s stupid it’s that’s I think a very limit in system and I feel that the problems are broader than that I think that they’re like did you ever sit like that
[INPUT]: you know if you ever watch Steve Bannon talk that either man like you know someone I would again not politically agree with for what it’s worth but when he’s description of what happened in that economic crash of 2000 and I and the decisions that were made further you know American taxpayer to bail out the life financial industry and I’ve subsequently seen a documentary that said look this is why we had to do that these were the options but for me that is a demonstration of capitalism’s inherent failings and but we’re not talking about a system that is flawless and perfect it’s pretty fucking flawed aside from the human collateral damage and that you have again described that the communities they’re impoverished and without hope and living in poverty in a kind of slavery you know even in itself doesn’t work according to its own rules. as they are officially sustained and reboot it when it inevitably fails just hold
[Joe Rogan]: the pure sign of it is that the fact that no one went to jail for the subprime mortgage crisis yeah those guys didn’t go to jail all those guys that with the real financial I know so we’re looking at from a distance they were going. I see where this is going like this is gonna blow up and a lot of people gonna lose their houses. like you guys are assholes like yeah then there was a lot of people that engaged in those predatory loans and they didn’t get punished those those guys the craziest thing is a lot of them got bonuses! yes that’s right they got bonuses even if the bank got bailed out and they said the bonuses were part of their contracts and if they didn’t honor their contracts they’d have a hard time hiring these people and there would be chaos and they’ve just made it a reason why they had to give them millions of dollars in bonuses yeah when they failed let me get a bonus and you’ve failed? like your bank failed and you still get a bonus? like you knew about those predatory loans you knew about those you do about the subprime mortgage bullshit that was going down in your business? yeah you just let it ride and now you’re gonna get a you’re gonna get a bonus what’s the bonus for? yeah what would you have to do to be fine if that’s yeah that’s the bonus you’d be jailed yeah I mean just think about what they’re doing a Julian Assange right they’re throwing that guy in a jail somewhere that can look good that embassy moves no but I mean the fact that what he did was release information that everybody found very interesting and what they did is crash the whole fucking economy.
[INPUT]: right he was able to write that embassy idea for as long as because it’s not actually in another country is it I went to visit him in there as a matter of fact just briefly popped in so anything’s gonna happen with him I think he’s gonna end up serving a pretty lumpy prison sentence somewhere is in April
[Joe Rogan]: I think they’re gonna get him on like what are they gonna charge him on they’re charging on like hacking charges or some shit now which they didn’t charge him on before right is that what’s
[INPUT]: emerged and he’s going to be extradited this country is that true I don’t know well I mean again I suppose this is what happens if you challenge the interest of the powerful
[Joe Rogan]: if Trump was really if Trump really want to get people on the side he pardoned them
[INPUT]: do you think that that would be popular because like someone like that Edward Snowden is it like look I’m yeah obviously I think don’t put the lives of people at risk that are in compromised military positions that seems like a fairly obvious thing but like I don’t think they did that but nice what
[Joe Rogan]: I understood was they got hacked and someone else released the documents without the names redacted yeah it seems to me where he leaks never did that it would it
[INPUT]: Snowden it seems to qualify for a hero in pretty much any way you look at it into a twenty six-year-old person making that decision and
[Joe Rogan]: yeah very brilliant you know I’ve heard him I think he was on neil degrasse tyson’s podcast they talked to him Wow but
[INPUT]: did you see in citizen four there’s a bit like in that film about Edward Snowden sits and for there’s a bit where he’s just come out and he’s talking to the journalists or filmmakers that are making the film it’s kind they can find watching with this phone you can’t leave that like every he’s like in the sort of a state of mad enlightenment where he’s just seen the truth of they’re listening to us now you can’t fucking have that on you like this it’s terrifying to watch on them because you know obviously now he’s calmed down he’s dealt with the understands that you know but he was like a person that was emerging from having seen the other side of the matrix yeah I mean he was deep into it and then when he revealed all the information they had a fucking they were had a manhunt for him the guy had a hideout in Russia he had a seek asylum in our enemy yes the whole thing is so strange yes so who do our power structures actually support if someone tells the truth to the population they have to flee to Russia if someone talks about improper agricultural practices that’s against the law they can be in prison they starts to reveal that the state itself the very thing that we Revere the very thing that we identify is the tool of our oppression
[Joe Rogan]: who want to discourage people from leaking information that makes them look horrible it’s that simple yes it’s that simple if you look at what information he leaked and what what it did well you know what he did was revealed things that everyone wanted to know about yet we felt were crimes
[INPUT]: it makes me feel that it’s as simple as if you knew what we do in order to keep shit you would revolt so we are never gonna let you know well that for me in a sense is a path the stuffing will hold on fucking me hell are you
[Joe Rogan]: I thought you are elected officials you’re one of us but no you’re above us to the point where someone leaks information about your crimes they get locked in this embassy for seven years like what is their crime exactly in comparison of the crimes that he’s revealed yes like that’s where it’s crazy did the when you look at the the balance the imbalance between what his crime is and the crimes that he’s revealed I mean he’s revealed some staggering crimes. and no one’s concentrating on that the government is not freaking out we’ve got a we’ve left some obviously uh we have work to do we have corrections to make there’s none of that talk there’s get that guy talk
[INPUT]: yeah that’s right and like it’s so under the veil of patriotism a lot can be concealed and and that is a incident that passes through several administrations so like you mean there for seven years yes it makes you people what is the what are the differences? you know like I kinda you know sort of I been on Bill Maher show I like Bill Maher I’m I’m you know very sympathetic to left you know I’m Alton Utley beyond left left-wing I’m you know trying to my belief is that we should trying to organize a system based on a hallucinogenic experience for fuck’s sake! there’s there’s no party for me. and I’m not even allowed to fucking Hallucigenia and it’s safe to say but like I feel that so many of the problems that we’re experiencing now is because the the Democratic left-wing liberal organizations stopped serving the people they were in the case of the British Labour Party designed set up to serve they neglected them they abandoned them you know they’re white weight or the white working-class in Britain were 50 60 years ago told hey there’s this thing called Britain we want you to go out there and fight and die for it give up your sons get out there and now they’re told hey there’s no such thing is Britain and like yeah no wonder people are confused! no wonder people are baffled! no wonder there are abandoned constituencies and despair and rage and I I feel the in a way it’s like what is patriotism resourced from a sense that we all need to belong that we want to be together you know that we’re willing to believe in a fictional idea a flag and a story about the you know the origin of a nation whether that’s an old one like mine or a new one like this one you know we’re willing to participate in that but if those values aren’t real if they aren’t like if it is we are gonna support the most powerful we will lie to you whenever necessary when our lies are revealed will imprison punish and lie about those people we don’t care about the most vulnerable what the fuck is the flag that we’re waving? who is it for?
"[Joe Rogan]: it’s a good point and on that note let’s wrap this bitch up good we went out high we went that was a good one was a good way to end it Russell you’re awesome man I love you each other every day you always like being around you and your book mentors it’s out now your podcast would be available on luminary starting 25 23rd of this month so just a few days ladies gentlemen that’s the end of the show[Joe Rogan]: Three, two, one, boom. Hello, Jack."
[INPUT]: What's up?
"[Joe Rogan]: Nice to meet you, man."
"[INPUT]: Nice to meet you, finally."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Keep this sucker like a fist from your face.
[INPUT]: Got it.
"[Joe Rogan]: Good. First of all. dude, you started a company. When you started Twitter, when you guys first started, did you have any idea -- Well, there's no way you could have had any idea what it would be now."
[INPUT]: No.
"[Joe Rogan]: But one of the things I always try to emphasize with people when people are like, Twitter's crazy, I'm like, How could it not be crazy? There's never been anything like it before. Like imagine trying to predict the kind of impact -- The President of the United States uses Twitter to threaten other countries."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, who the fuck saw that coming?"
[INPUT]: Not us.
[Joe Rogan]: Nobody saw that coming.
[INPUT]: Not us.
[Joe Rogan]: What did you think it was going to be when you first did it?
"[INPUT]: Well, you know, we were building this thing for ourselves. And that's how everything starts. We wanted to use it. We wanted to stay connected with each other. We-"
[Joe Rogan]: Like a group text almost?
[INPUT]: Like a group text. We loved our phones. We loved technology. We actually started this as a hack week project out of a failed company called Odeo. It's podcasting.
[Joe Rogan]: I remember that. I remember Odeo.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Super early on. We were really creative folks, but we weren't that passionate about where podcasting was going in our particular domain. And we just got a lot of competition early on. iTunes just released a podcast directory, but we knew we wanted to work together. We knew we love this idea of one-button publishing, we love this idea of collaboration, we love this idea of being anywhere, and being able to share what was happening. That was the idea. I mean, that was it, and that's what we wanted it to be."
"[INPUT]: And I think the most beautiful and, also, sometimes, uncomfortable aspect of Twitter is we really learned what it wanted to be, and the people helped create it. Like everything that we hold sacred now, the @ symbol, the hashtag, the retweet, those were not invented by me or the company. Those were things that we discovered, things that we discovered people using. And we just observed it, and we noticed what they were trying to do. They're trying to talk with one another. They were trying to collect tweets around topics with a hashtag."
[Joe Rogan]: Has anybody figured out when the first use of hashtag something was created?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it was actually our Lead Designer, Robert Anderson, who leads our design of the Cash App. Hired him for a Square later on, but he was the first one. He was actually communicating with his brother, and he put @Buzz. His brother's name is Buzz. And it just spread. It wasn't en masse, but people were doing it."
"[INPUT]: But what was most interesting is not what they're doing, but what they wanted to do with it. They wanted to address each other. And that changed the company completely. That changed the service because it went from just broadcasting what's happening to conversation and to being able to address anyone publicly out in the open, which, came with it, a lot of power and, also, a lot of issues as well."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. The use of hashtags, like looking up #Fryfest or hashtag -- Anytime that something weird that's in the news, that's such a unique way to find things. But to go on Twitter and to utilize that, it's -- I mean, it's interesting that this guy just did it just to contact his brother."
"[INPUT]: Well, that was the @ symbol. The hashtag was this guy, Chris Messina."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, different guy."
"[INPUT]: And he was trying to tag around topics that he was tweeting about. And, again, that spread. All we did was made it easier. We made it more accessible. We enabled everyone to do it. With the @ symbol, we made a page that collected all mentions of your name. With the hashtag, we allowed people to search immediately, so you could tap on the keyword, and you would see everyone talking about that or tweeting about that specific hashtag. So, these things were just emergent behaviors that we didn't predict, and they became the lifeblood of the service."
[Joe Rogan]: What's fascinating to me about something like Twitter or even something like YouTube is that there's not a lot of other ones like it. There's just this one thing.
[INPUT]: Absolutely.
[Joe Rogan]: Like how does that happen-
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... where this one thing sort of gets adopted by everybody and takes over, and then just becomes these overwhelmingly massive platform? I mean, there's really -- Here's Vimeo and there's a few other videos services, but nothing on the scale of YouTube. And that's the same thing with Twitter. There's nothing on the scale of distributing information in a quick, short, 280-character form like that."
"[INPUT]: I don't think we could plan for it. I don't think we could necessarily build for that. Someone said recently too, we just gathered a bunch of our leadership last week in Palm Springs for an offsite, and someone said recently that Twitter was discovered. And I think what's behind all that is that it hit something foundational. It hit something essential. And my co-founder, Biz, likes to say that Twitter can never be uninvented. It's here. It changed everything, but the use of it has been revolutionary."
"[INPUT]: And it's just a simple idea of if you could text with the entire world, if you could actually reach anyone in the world, or anyone could see what you're thinking, which I think is also the beautiful thing about text and the medium, you can actually get someone's raw thoughts, and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously. It becomes a subconscious. It becomes this like global consciousness. And it gets to some really deep places in society. And some of those places are pretty uncomfortable."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it also gets to some really deep places psychologically. There's a weirdness to it, right? There's a weirdness to-"
[INPUT]: Definitely.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... sending text particularly @anonymously, and there's so many accounts that are just an egg."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: There's so many accounts where they're clearly designed. Like sometimes, someone will twit something mean to me, and I'm like, Hmm, I wonder what this person's up to? So, I go to their site, and it's just them tweeting mean shit at people all day long. Like it's probably some angry person at work, and they're like, I'm just going to find people and fuck with them all day."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Did you realize or when did you realize -- I'm sure you're aware of it. When did you realize that this was almost out of your control in terms of the scale of it?
"[INPUT]: There wasn't one moment. There wasn't one moment that it just felt completely resonant. It's unfolded into the next thing, and the next used case, and it just keeps surprising us with how people are using it. You know, it definitely -- Recently, I think, we've identified some of the areas of the service that we need to pay a lot more attention to."
"[INPUT]: Twitter is unique, and that it has two main spaces. One, which is your timeline. And those are the people that you follow. And when you follow someone, they've earned that audience. And then, it has this other world where anyone can insert themselves into the conversation. They can actually mention you, and you'll see that without asking for it. You can insert yourself into hashtags, into search, and these are areas that people have taken advantage of, and these are the areas that people have gamed our systems to, in some cases, artificially amplify it but, also, just to spread a lot of things that weren't possible with a velocity that they're not possible before."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, when this is all happening, what's the conversation like at Twitter? When you're recognizing that this is happening, that people are gaming the system, like, what do -- How do you guys -- How do you mitigate it? What's the discussion?"
"[INPUT]: Well, early on, it was pretty surface level like, how do we change some of the app dynamics? But more recently, we're trying to go a lot deeper and asking ourselves a question. When people open Twitter, what are we incentivizing? What are we telling them to do when they open up this app? We may not explicitly be doing that, but there's something that we're saying without being as clear about it. So, what does the like button incentivize? What does the retweet incentivize? What does the number of followers and making that number big and bold incentivize?"
"[INPUT]: So, I'm not sure what we should not -- I'm not sure if we should incentivize anything, but we need to understand what that is. And I think, right now, we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers because we don't make it easy for people to follow interests and topics. It's only accounts. We incentivize a lot of outrage and hot takes because of some of the dynamics in the service not allowing a lot of nuance and conversation earlier on."
"[INPUT]: Pseudonyms, this ability to not use your real name, incentivizes some positive things like it allows for whistleblowers and journalists who might fear for their career or, even worse, their life and under certain regimes but, also, allows for people, like the example you mentioned, of just random fire and spread of abuse and harassment throughout."
"[INPUT]: So, those are the things that we're looking at. And how do we enable more of the conversation to evolve? How do we increase the credibility or reputation of accounts? How do we identify credible voices within a particular domain? Not just through this very coarse, grain, blue, verified badge, but if you're an expert in a particular topic how do we recognize that in real time and show that, so that we can provide more context to who you're talking to, and if you want to engage in a deeper conversation or just ignore, mute, or block them?"
"[Joe Rogan]: But what is the conversation like while you're at work? Like when you're realizing that all this stuff is happening, and you're realizing that, now -- I mean, particularly, because the president uses it so often. It's such a -- I mean, it's his preferred platform for communicating with the people, I mean, even more so than addresses. It's very strange."
"[Joe Rogan]: What's the conversation like in the office when you're trying to figure out, Hey, what's our responsibility here? Like, how are we supposed to handle this? How do we- I mean, in some ways, what Twitter is doing is it's really kind of -- it's flavoring the public narrative. It's flavoring the way we communicate with each other in our culture worldwide."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, the conversation has definitely evolved. I think, in the past, we just got super reactive. We were reacting to all the negative things that we're seeing, and that led to a lot of short-term thinking. More recently, we've just looked much deeper. We don't react to the present day. We look for some of the patterns."
"[INPUT]: And, you know, we have a company that is not just serving the people of this particular country, the United States. This is global. We have global leaders all around the world using us in different ways. Some, with a higher velocity. Some recognize more the power. Some put out statements. Some lead conversations. But it's looking at all those dynamics and not trying to hyper focus on any one, a particular one, because if we do, we're only building it for one portion of the population or only one perceived present-day crisis."
"[Joe Rogan]: But what I'm trying to get at was like, okay, when things come up, like, say, if you find out that there's people from ISIS that are using Twitter, and they're using Twitter and posting things, like, what is the conversation like? How do -- What do we do about this? Do we leave this up? Do we recognize this is free speech? Do we only take it down if they're calling for murder or hate speech? Like, what -- How do you handle that?"
"[INPUT]: Well, it evolves, I mean, because we first saw ISIS when the world saw ISIS. And we needed to change our policy to deal with it."
"[Joe Rogan]: What was the initial reaction to it? So, once you realized that people from ISIS were making Twitter accounts, and they were trying to recruit people, and doing all these things, what was the thought process?"
"[INPUT]: It's the question, like, what are we going to do about this?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: We haven't experienced this before. We need to-
"[Joe Rogan]: Nobody has. I mean, you're essentially pioneers."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but there are people who have experienced it in different forms and different mediums. So, we reach out to our government partners and friends and to our law enforcement partners. We reached out to our peer companies to ask if they're seeing the same things that we're seeing. We have a bunch of civil societies that we talk to to get their take on it as well. And we try to balance that across, you know, varied spectrums, whether it'd be, you know, more organizations that are more focused on preventing online harassment, all the way to the ACLU and EFF who are protecting the First Amendment online."
"[INPUT]: So, we try to get as many perspectives as possible, take that, and then make some informed decisions, but also realize that we're probably going to make some mistakes along the way, and all we can do to correct some of that is just be open about where we are. And that's probably where we failed the most in the past is we just haven't been open about our thinking process, what led to particular decisions, how our Terms of Service evolve. In Terms of Service as an area in our industry, it's just a -- it's a mess. No one reads them."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You know, you sign up for these services, and you quickly hit accept."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And we expect people to read these rules of the road, but they haven't read them, and-"
[Joe Rogan]: Have you ever read them?
[INPUT]: I have read them read.
[Joe Rogan]: You've read your own.
[INPUT]: I've read-
[Joe Rogan]: Have you read Facebook's?
[INPUT]: I haven't read Facebook's.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. You-
[INPUT]: I'm not on Facebook.
[Joe Rogan]: You're not on it?
[INPUT]: I'm not on Facebook.
"[Joe Rogan]: Wow. Fuck Facebook, right? No, I'm just kidding. What about Instagram, you've read theirs?"
[INPUT]: I was in the first 10 users of Instagram.
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: Kevin was an intern. Kevin Systrom was an intern at Odeo. And I was one of the first investors of Instagram and love the service. I don't think I've ever read their Terms of Service.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, even you."
"[INPUT]: Even me. But I read ours, and one of the things I noticed right away as, you know, you read our Terms of Service, and one of the first things that we put at the top of the page was copyright and intellectual property protections. You go down, and you scroll down, and you see everything about violent threats, and abuse, and harassment, and safety. And it's not that the company intended for that to be the order. It's just we just added things going on."
[INPUT]: But even a read of that puts forth our point of view. Like we're actually putting copyright infringement above the safety-
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: ... the physical safety of someone. So, we need to relook at some of these things, and how they've evolved, and how they reacted, and-"
"[Joe Rogan]: But is it above just because it's listed second? I mean, they're essentially all in the same one sheet."
[INPUT]: They're on the one sheet.
"[Joe Rogan]: When you bring it up, when you discuss it first, is that really critical? They're all part of the Terms of Service."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but I think that ordering matters. Like, what do we consider to be most important?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: And we have to consider physical safety to be that one thing that we protect the most.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: And I-
"[Joe Rogan]: So, physical threats."
[INPUT]: Physical threats.
[Joe Rogan]: Doxxing.
"[INPUT]: Doxxing, anything that impinges on someone's physical safety. This is an area where I don't think technology and services like ours have focused on enough. We haven't focused on the off-platform ramifications of what happens online."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, what do you do, like, here's a good for instance. This situation with this young kid who had the MAGA hat on, and the Native American gentleman who was in front of him banging the drum. And then, people are calling for this kid's name. They want his name, they want his address, including Kathy Griffin. Like, how do you handle something like that?"
[INPUT]: Well-
[Joe Rogan]: Because that's essentially request for doxxing.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And that is a new vector that we haven't seen en masse. I mean, these are the cases that bring up entirely new things. So, we have to study it. We have to see how we reacted, what happened with the network. But this goes back to the incentives. Like we are incentivizing this very quick reaction, and it's taking away from some more of the, like, considered work that we need to do to really diagnose what's happening in the moment. And it was -- It's such an interesting case study to see how that evolved over just 48 hours. And-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes. That's one of the most fascinating news cycles or stories in the news cycle in quite a while because it's nuanced. There's many different levels to it.
"[INPUT]: It's extremely nuanced, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: And a lot of like really knee-jerk reactions.
"[INPUT]: Totally, but we helped that."
[Joe Rogan]: How did you help it?
"[INPUT]: Well, it's just that's how some of the dynamics of the service work. And those are the things we control."
"[Joe Rogan]: But is that how some of the dynamics of the service or is it the way people choose to use the service? Like, if you are a thoughtful person, you wouldn't just -- Like, for instance, the original image that was distributed came from an account that's now banned, right? And so, it was discovered that that account was a troll account. How does that happen? And what was the thought process behind that? Because the image that they posted was a legitimate image. It really did happen. It was a part of an actual occurring event. So, why did you ban the person or the troll account that put it up?"
"[INPUT]: I don't know about this particular case, but it's likely that it was found -- There's a lot of what you see on the surface of Twitter, and some of the actions that we take on the surface, but where we spend a lot of our enforcement is actually what's happening underneath. So, in many cases, we have trolls or people, like the case that you mentioned, whose sole purpose is just to harass, or abuse, or spread particular information. And, oftentimes, these accounts might be connected, or they start one account that gets banned, they start another account. But we can actually see this through a network lens, and we can actually see some of those behaviors. So, that might have been one of the reasons. I'm not sure in that particular case but, you know, the-"
[Joe Rogan]: How do you know? Do you know because of IP addresses? Do you know because of the-
"[INPUT]: A variety of things. So, it could be trying to use the same phone number or same e-mail address, IP addresses, device IDs, all these things that we can use to judge what's happening within the context. So, we do have a lot of occurrences of suspending or temporarily suspending accounts because of activities across accounts. And that happens a ton. But what I mean in that we're helping this right now is like some of the incentives, like just imagine seeing that unfold, and when you see someone with one take, it kind of embolden something to follow along, and then this mob kind of rolls."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So, there has to be a way for us to incentivize a lot more considered and more nuanced introspection of what's going on."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, give everybody mushrooms. It's probably the only way. I don't know. How are you going to get people to be more considerate? I mean, what-"
[INPUT]: Providing more context.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, this is essentially your engineering social behavior, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, providing more context."
[Joe Rogan]: Providing more context. How so?
"[INPUT]: Providing more context. Like, an example, let's say Brexit for example."
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: So, if I followed a bunch of accounts, I like Boris Johnson who is constantly giving me information about reasons to leave, I would probably only see that perspective."
[Joe Rogan]: Nigel Farage.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And those -- A lot of folks just will not follow accounts that have a completely different perspective or a different influence. A number of people do. Hopefully, journalists do. But most people won't do that work. So, this is the only tool we give people[Joe Rogan]: Easy for anyone to follow-"
[INPUT]: Follow the hashtag.
[Joe Rogan]: ... outside of perspective.
"[INPUT]: Follow the hashtag, follow a topic, follow an interest. And because of that, we help build an echo chamber and something that doesn't really challenge any perspective. And not to say that we should force it upon people, but we don't even make it easy for people to do in the first place. So, the way you do that today is you go the explorer tab, you look, you search for a hashtag, or you tap into a hashtag, and you can see all the conversation."
"[INPUT]: But that's work. And most people just won't do the work. They'll stay in their timeline, and they'll see what they need to see, and I can certainly imagine why if I'm just following a bunch of people who have the exact same take on this, it just continues to embolden, and embolden, and embolden, and they see nothing of a different perspective on the exact same situation."
"[Joe Rogan]: What's interesting to me is the difference between Twitter and Instagram. Essentially, it's not just the photographs. What's weird that has happened was there's shitty people on Instagram as well. I mean, there's a lot of arguments and things along those lines, but they don't overwhelm the initial post; whereas, with Twitter-"
[INPUT]: Totally different surface.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Instagram is a post. I mean, it's a post that's not really eliciting conversation. It's eliciting comments."
[Joe Rogan]: But not just that. It's difficult to follow the conversations.
[INPUT]: I don't think there is a conversation. It's-.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, sometimes, there is. Sometimes, people are going back and forth about a particular subject that's discussed in the initial post, but it's not very clear."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Whereas with Twitter, it's only conversational."
[INPUT]: It's only conversation.
"[Joe Rogan]: But even if there's a photograph, even if somebody posts a photograph on Twitter and has conversation under it, the photograph seems to be lack of secondary importance."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's super fluid and super messy too."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: But the thing is every -- On Instagram or any blog, you have this post, the statement, and you have comments underneath; whereas, with Twitter, everything is on the same surface."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: It's all one surface.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. My friend, Kurt Metzger, likes that about Facebook. He says because in Twitter, he goes, I post something, and then all these fucking morons post something. And he goes -- You know Kurt, he's very animated. He's like, And their shit looks just like my shit. It's all together, all piled up. He goes, But if I post something on Facebook, he goes, I have this whole thing. Like this is the original statement."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, my control."
"[Joe Rogan]: And then, underneath it, yeah, you fucking say whatever you want, but no one's no one's reading."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like they're reading the original initial post, and it's clear that there's a differentiation between the initial post and the secondary post."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. You know, there's room for both models, but this conversation, most conversations, it's not you making a statement, and me just reacting to that."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Like our conversation of all of us based on what we say. We can interrupt one another. We can-
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: You know, we can completely change the subject. I can take control of the conversation. And the people who might find that interesting follow it. And the folks that don't just stop listening; whereas, you can't do that in a post-comment model."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Also, text is so limited. I mean, it's great for just getting on actual facts, but it's-"
"[INPUT]: Also thinking. It's just so close to thinking, right. There's no composition."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You know. And that, to me, is the most beautiful thing about Twitter, but also something that, you know, can be uncomfortable. Like I can compose my life on Instagram, I can compose my thoughts within a Facebook post, and they can look so perfect, but the best to Twitter is just super raw, and it's right to the thinking process. And I just think that's so beautiful because it gets to consciousness. It gets us something deeper. And I think that deeper-"
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, how so? How is it different than a post on Instagram or a post on Facebook?"
"[INPUT]: The speed demands. You know, the character constraint, the speed kind of just demands a more conscious, present, focused thinking versus like stepping back and-"
[Joe Rogan]: Composing a letter.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, and composing a letter, and thinking about all the outcomes."
"[Joe Rogan]: But, oftentimes, people do compose it as a letter, and they break it up into separate 280-character posts."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, the thread."
[Joe Rogan]: What was the thought process in going from 140 to 280? Because the one thing that I liked about 140 is you can't be verbose.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: You can't just ramble and, you know, like, it's great for comics because it forces us to write jokes like with the economy of words."
"[INPUT]: Exactly. We found a lot of resonance with journalist because of the headlines. We found a lot of resonance with comics because of the rhythm. And we found a lot of resonance with hip hop as well because of the bars, and just the structure, and the constraint allowed that flow. The thinking was we looked at, you know, languages around the world, and there's some languages like German, 140 characters, you can't really say much. You can't really say much at all."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, because the words are so long."
"[INPUT]: There are some languages like Japanese, 140 characters is 140 words. And what was interesting about Japan was Japan is one of our largest countries where we're bigger than Facebook there. We're-"
[Joe Rogan]: Are you not bigger than Facebook in America?
[INPUT]: No.
"[Joe Rogan]: What the fuck? I don't even use Facebook. Sorry, Facebook."
[INPUT]: I don't either.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, I use it in terms of if I post something on Instagram, it goes to Facebook."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: But when I go to Facebook, it just seems like a lot of -- Well, this does seem like Twitter too, a lot of arguing. But Twitter seems to be more fun, if that makes any sense. Even though there's a lot of chaos, when something -- One of my favorite things is when someone posts something stupid, and then underneath it is a bunch of GIFs. Do we says GIFs or GIFs? How do you say GIF? Does anybody know?"
[INPUT]: Ask him.
[INPUT]: GIFs. GIFs.
[Joe Rogan]: How do you say?
[INPUT]: I say GIFs. I know it's juries out.
[Joe Rogan]: A bunch of GIFs that are hilarious.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like I was just mocking someone relentlessly. Like that is one of my favorite things about Twitter. When someone, like Donald Trump posts something ridiculous, and then I'll go, and I'll look at the responses, like, Baaaa. How do you care?"
[INPUT]: It's a public conversation. You can-.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: You can see how everyone react, but like it's all -- The interesting thing about Twitter is there's not one Twitter. It's like you have politics Twitter, which can be super toxic. You have sports Twitter, you have NBA Twitter, you have MMA Twitter, you have a UFC Twitter, you have KPop Twitter, you have e-sports, whatever."
[Joe Rogan]: Black sports.
[INPUT]: You have black Twitter.
[Joe Rogan]: That's Jaime's. Jaime loves black Twitter.
"[INPUT]: You have all these different twitters, and you have a completely different experience-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: ... based on what Twitter you follow-
[Joe Rogan]: Sure.
[INPUT]: ... and what Twitter you participate in.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Some of them are like super engaging, super funny. Some of them are you want to walk away from it."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I got to a certain point where I couldn't read replies anymore. I just, Hmm. It's just -- Not that it's that toxic. The vast majority of interactions I have with people are super positive."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, absolutely like more than 99%. But it's -- I didn't -- I don't have time, and I don't have time to be constantly responding to people. And it just didn't -- The sheer numbers. I think when I got around 3 million-ish followers I'm like, I can't do this anymore. It's just it's overwhelming. Like I don't have the resources."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I am a huge believer in serendipity. So, you look at your replies once, and you might see something that just like strikes you, and that's enough. You don't need to read through all of them."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, sometimes."
[INPUT]: And it's just-
"[Joe Rogan]: But then, you might miss something groovy."
"[INPUT]: You might, but I also believe the most important things come back up."
"[Joe Rogan]: What I used to do a lot, I would go through my mentions. And when people would essentially use that as almost a news aggregator. I'll go through my mentions that people would post cool stories, and I would retweet those. And so, because people knew that I would retweet them, they would send me a lot of cool stuff. So, because of that, because it's reciprocating, I got a lot of really cool stuff sent my way."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're pushing. You're pushing more out to expand the network."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And I reinforced it. I just I wanted to thank people for posting cool stuff, and they love the fact they would get a retweet. And so, they would send me like interesting science stories or, you know, very bizarre nature stories. And I'd just be retweeting them all the time. Go to -- But then, after a while, I'm like, This is a lot of time. It's a lot of time. So, now, essentially, what I do is I just post something and I'm just kind of like, Ugh. I just walk away."
"[INPUT]: But that, I mean, that speaks to what we want to incentivize more. We want more people contributing things back to the network, back to the-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Back to the public conversation. And I know it doesn't feel like this today for most people, but my ideal is someone walks away from Twitter learning something, and they're actually learning something entirely new."
[Joe Rogan]: I think that happens a lot.
[INPUT]: And it might be a new perspective.
[Joe Rogan]: That happens a lot.
[INPUT]: It probably happens more often than we think.
[Joe Rogan]: Depending on who you follow.
[INPUT]: Exactly.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It's all dependent on the Twitter you follow. And like, you know, the health Twitter is amazing. You know, I learned some. Like I followed Rhonda Patrick and a bunch of folks who are into sauna."
[Joe Rogan]: She's amazing. Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And Wim Hof and [Ice Bess] and Ben Greenfield. And you just follow them, and you just get all this new information about alternative views of how to stay healthy, how to live longer. And I can't find that anywhere else-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: ... in one place like that.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And then, it's not just them broadcasting. When they retweet something or when they tweet something, there's a whole conversation about it. So, you know, some people say this is -- you know, This has not been my experience, or This is not true for me, or Actually, have you seen this connected thing? And I just go down this rabbit hole, and I learn so much. But that's not the experience for everyone. ***"
"[Joe Rogan]: No. Well, yeah, it's not the experience for everyone, and it's not really -- I don't think it's what everyone wants either. Sometimes, people just like to go on there and talk shit."
[INPUT]: That's true.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, someone that's trapped in a cubicle right now, and they just want to go in there, and get in arguments about gun control or, you know, whether or not Nancy Pelosi is the devil. And this is-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: This is what -- You know, it serves a purpose for them."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: The thing that gets strange though is who's to decide. You know, there's this concept -- There's a discussion, I should say, where some people believe that things like Twitter, or Facebook, or any forum where you're having a public discussion should be considered almost like a public utility. Like anyone has access to the electric power. Even if you are -- You know, even if you're a racist, you still can get electricity. And some people think that you should have that same ability with something like Twitter or the same ability with something like Instagram. Obviously, this is -- We're in uncharted territory. And you-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: You are in uncharted territory.
[INPUT]: Totally.
"[Joe Rogan]: Just no one has been there before. So, who makes the distinctions? When you see someone that it's saying something that you might think is offensive to some folks but not offensive to the person who's saying it, maybe the person who's saying it feels like they need to express themselves, and this is important to say, and how do you decide whether or not this is a valid discussion, or if this is hate speech, which is -- You know there's some things that are hate speech, and there's sometimes people who use the term hate speech, and it's just a cheap way to shut down a conversation."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. So, the simple answer is we look at conduct. We don't look at the speech itself, we look at conduct. We look at how the tool is being used. And you're right in that, like, I think when people see Twitter, they see and they expect it to be a public square. They can go into that public square, they can say whatever they want, they can get on a pedestal, and people might gather around them, and listen to what they have to say. Some of them might find it offensive and they leave. The difference is there's, also, this concept of this megaphone. And the megaphone can be highly targeted now with Twitter as well."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, it's not the speech. It's how it's amplified."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, what do you do if, like, say -- Let's say there's someone in the media. Let's say it's a prominent feminist. And then, you have a bunch of people or let's say just one person, and their Twitter feed is overwhelmingly attacking this prominent feminist. Just constantly a tagger, calling her a liar, calling her this, calling her that. When do you decide this is harassment? When do you decide this is hate speech? Like, how do you -- I mean, this is-"
[INPUT]: We look at the context.
"[Joe Rogan]: This is a fictional account, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: Fictional person we're talking about. But in this for instance, what would dictate something that was egregious enough for you to eliminate them from your platform?"
"[INPUT]: Well, that's a heavy action. So, that's the last resort. But we look at the conduct. We look at -- Oftentimes, as you said, the probability of someone who is harassing one person, it's highly probable that they're also harassing 10 more people."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, we can look at that behavior. We can look at how many times this person is being blocked, or muted, or reported. And based on all those, all that data, we can actually take some action. But we also have to -- We have to correlate it with the other side of that because people go on, and they coordinate blocks as well, and they coordinate harassment, and they coordinate -- I'm sorry not harassment but reporting. Reporting a particular account to get it shut down and to take the voice off the service."
"[INPUT]: So, these are the considerations we have to make, but it all starts with conduct. And, oftentimes, we'll see coordinated conduct, whether it'd be that one person opening multiple accounts or coordinating with multiple accounts that they don't own to go after someone. And there's a bunch of vectors that people use retweet for that, the tweet for that a lot as well. Like they'll quote tweet a tweet that someone finds, and they'll say, Look at this idiot. Twitter, do your thing. And then just this mob starts, and goes, and tries to effectively shut that person down."
"[INPUT]: So, there's a bunch of tools we can use. The permanent suspension is the last resort. One of the things that we can do is we can down-rank the replies. So, any of these behaviors and conduct that looked linked, we can actually push farther down in the reply chain. So, it's all still there, but you might have to push a button to actually see it. You might have to show more replies to actually see this harassing account or what might look like harassing language."
[Joe Rogan]: And this is manually done or this-
"[INPUT]: No, no, no. This is all automated."
[Joe Rogan]: It's automated?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: But how would you know?
"[INPUT]: A lot of the ranking, and looking at amplification, and looking at the network is automated."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Like in terms of down-ranking, is there a discussion as to whether or not this person's reply should be down-ranked? How do you figure that out?"
[INPUT]: It's a machine learning and deep learning model and they just-
"[Joe Rogan]: Whoa. So, it's AI?"
"[INPUT]: It's AI, and they learn."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, Christ."
"[INPUT]: And we look at how these things are doing, and where they make mistakes, and then we improve it. It's just constantly improving, constantly learning."
"[Joe Rogan]: Does that feel like censorship to you, like automated censorship? Because, I mean, who is to decide other than people whether or not something is valid?"
"[INPUT]: Well, we're not looking at the speech in this particular case. We're looking at the conduct."
[Joe Rogan]: The conduct.
[INPUT]: The conduct of someone in fast velocity attacking someone else.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: Right. So, those are the things that our technology allows. It changes the velocity. It changes how to broadcast a message that someone didn't really ask for and didn't want to hear. We don't touch -- If I follow Joe Rogan, you'll see every single tweet. We don't touch it. Right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But that's an audience that you earn. But in your replies page, we have a little bit more room because this is a conversation that starts up, and some people just want to disrupt it. And all we're saying is we're going to look and move in the disruption down. Not that it's hidden, but it's still there, but you just see it a little bit further down."
"[Joe Rogan]: Like, there was -- What was the instance with Ari? I should text him right now, get him to answer me in real time. But Ari Shaffir got kicked off Twitter because he said something to Bert like, Bert, I'm going to fucking kill you. Bert Kreischer, being our good friend, all of us are good friends, and he's like, You fucking dummy, I want to kill you, or something like that."
"[INPUT]: He took his record albums. He said like, I'm going to steal and break them all. He jokingly got mad."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, right, right."
[INPUT]: That's Ari though.
"[Joe Rogan]: Bert was -- I think it was all bullshit, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: I don't mean Bert really stole his records.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He kept them. Yeah, he gave them back to him eventually."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: He's like< I'm going to fucking kill you.
"[INPUT]: So, what happened or probably happened, and I'm not sure of that particular case, but what probably what happened there is someone might have reported that tweet. One of our agents, human agent, without context of their friendship or that relationship, saw it as a violent threat and took action on that."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: And those are the mistakes that we're going to make. That's why we need an appeals process.
"[Joe Rogan]: Or Bert needs to keep his fucking greasy hands off Aris' records, right?"
[INPUT]: That's probably not going to happen. We need to make sure that we're reacting the right way.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Like, look, we're going to make mistakes. We're trying to -- The problem with the system right now is most of the work and the burden is actually on the victims of abuse while they're getting harassed. So, a lot of our system doesn't enforce or act unless these tweets are reported, right? So, we don't take suspension actions or removal of content actions unless it's reported."
"[INPUT]: The algorithms rank and order the conversation, but they don't take suspension actions. They don't remove content. They might suggest to a human to look at this, who might look at our rules, and look at the content, and try to look at the context of the conversation, and then take action. But we would like to move towards a lot more automated enforcement."
"[INPUT]: But more importantly, how do we highlight? How do we amplify more of the healthier discussion and conversation? Again, not removing it. We're going to a world, especially with technology like blockchain that all content that exist, that is ever created will exist forever. You won't be able to take it down. You won't be able to censor it. It won't be centralized at all."
"[INPUT]: Our role is around what we recommend based on your interest, and based on who you follow, and helping you to get into that on ramp. But if you look at the arc of technology, it's a given that anytime something is created, it's going to exist forever. This is what blockchain helps enable down the line. And we need to make sure that we're paying attention to that, and also realizing that our role is like, how do we get people the stuff that they really want to see, and they find valuable, that they'll learn from, that will make them think, that will help them evolve the conversation as well."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, when you say amplify the messages that you deemed to be more positive, right, like how do you decide that?"
[INPUT]: People decide it.
[Joe Rogan]: People decide.
"[INPUT]: People decide it based on like, Are they engaging in replies? Are they retweeting it? Are they liking it? Are they-"
"[Joe Rogan]: But, sometimes, it's really negative. Like, sometimes, the people that are engaging in it, engaging, they're attacking someone. So, is that valuable, or is it just unfortunate?"
"[INPUT]: It's valuable. I mean, every signal is something that we can learn from, and we can act on. But it's going to constantly evolve."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: I mean, these models that we have to build will constantly have to learn what the network is doing and how people are using it. And our goal is healthy contribution back to the public conversation. That is what we want. We want to encourage people into more bigger, informative, global conversations that they will learn from."
"[Joe Rogan]: Are you constantly aware of how much this is changing society, and that you are one of the four or five different modalities that are radically changing society? Whether it's Facebook, or Instagram, or any of these social media companies, it's radically changing the way people communicate with each other. There's a giant impact on the way human beings talk and see each other. And the way we process ideas and the way we distribute information is unprecedented. There's never been anything like that before. And you setting up something that you think it's going to be a group chat."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you member the early days when you would say like @Jack is going to the movies. You would say it. Like, that's how we would say it. I would say @JoeRogan is on his way to dinner."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That's how people would do it.
[INPUT]: The status.
[Joe Rogan]: It's fucking -- it was weird-
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... that somewhere along the line, that morphed, and it's-"
[INPUT]: It morphed because that's what the world wanted to do with it.
[Joe Rogan]: That's what they wanted to do with it.
[INPUT]: That's where they wanted to take it.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And I just think it's so reflective of what the world is and, in some cases, what the world wants to be."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it's a pathway for thinking. Just a pathway for people to get their thoughts out, but a really -- a powerful one, an unprecedented method of distributing information. It's really nothing ever been like this before."
"[INPUT]: No, no. And it won't. This mode of communicating will not go away. It will just get faster. It will become a lot more connected. And that's why our work is so critical to figure out some of the dynamics at play, that make it -- that cause more negative outcomes and positive outcomes."
"[Joe Rogan]: I think about it because -- Well, I think about it because it's just a hugely, significant thing. But I also think about it because of podcasts because podcasts are in a similar way. Just no one saw it coming, and the people that are involved in it are like, What the fuck are we doing?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like me, I'm like, What am I doing? What is this?."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like, for me, it's like, Oh boy, I get to talk to guys like Ben Greenfield, and Jonathan Haidt, and all these different people to learn some stuff. And I've clearly learned way more from doing this podcast than I ever would have learned without it. No doubt about it, unquestionably. But I didn't fucking plan this."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, now, all the sudden, there's this signal that I'm sending out to millions and millions of people. And then, people are like, Well, you have a responsibility. I'm like, Oh great. Well, I didn't want that. I didn't want a responsibility to what I distribute. I just want to be able to have a freak show, just talk to people, like whatever. There's certain people that I have on whether it's Alex Jones or anyone that's controversial where people will get fucking mad. Why are you giving this person a platform? I go, Okay. Hmm, I didn't think about it that way and, and I don't think that's what I'm doing. I think I'm talking to people and you can listen."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: But it's giving that person a platform because they're saying, Well, no, they'll tone down. Like Milo Yiannopoulos, that was one of the arguments people gave me. Like he toned down his platform when he was on your show, so you could get more people to pay attention to him. I'm like, Okay, but he also talked about- That was one of the reasons why he was exposed was my show because he talked about that it's okay to have sex with underaged boys if they're gay because there was like a mentor relationship between the older gay man and the younger, and people were like, What the fuck are you talking about?"
"[Joe Rogan]: And that was a big part of why he's been removed from the public conversation. That was one of the things. And then, there's the discussion like, Well, what is that? What is removing someone from the public conversation? If someone is very popular, and they have all these people that like to listen to them, what is the responsibility of these platforms, whether it's YouTube, or Twitter, or anyone. What is their responsibility to decide whether or not someone should or shouldn't be able to speak?"
"[Joe Rogan]: And this is a thing that I've been struggling with, and it bounced around inside my own head, and I see that you guys struggle with it, and pretty much everyone does. Youtube does. And it is a hugely significant discussion that is left to a very relatively small amount of people. And this is why this discussion of what is social media? Is it something and everybody has a right to, or is it something that should be restricted to only people that are willing to behave and carry themselves in a certain way?"
[INPUT]: I believe it's something that everyone has a right to.
"[Joe Rogan]: Everyone has a right to, but you still ban people. Let's say like, Alex Jones. you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the platform. You were the last ones."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally, right?"
"[INPUT]: No, no, no, no. He did not-"
"[Joe Rogan]: He came to your house, he begged."
"[INPUT]: No, no. You know, he did a very different things on our platform versus the others."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, okay."
"[INPUT]: So, we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform banning him, and then another, another, another in very, very quick succession."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. And people, I think, would have assumed that we would just have followed suit, but he didn't violate our Terms of Service."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And afterwards, he did. And we have -- You know, we a policy. And if there's a violation, we take enforcement actions. One might be asking the account holder to delete the tweet. Another might be a temporary suspension. Another might be a permanent suspension."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, what you're saying -- So, like, let's use it in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake. He did not say that on the platform. He did not say that on Twitter. He only said that on his show."
[INPUT]: I don't know all the mediums he said it in.
[Joe Rogan]: What did he do?
[INPUT]: What we're looking at is the conduct and what he did on our platform.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, what did he do on your platform that was like -- that you all were in agreement that this is enough?"
"[INPUT]: I'm not sure what the actual, like, violations were. But we have a set number of actions. And if they keep getting -- If an account keeps violating Terms of Service, ultimately, it leads to permanent suspension. And when all the other platforms are taking him off, we didn't find those. We didn't find those violations, and they weren't reported. But again, it goes back to a lot of our model. People weren't reporting a lot of the tweets that may have been in violation on our service, and we didn't act on them."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Like a good instance is what's going on with Patreon. I'm sure you're aware of the Sargon of Akkad thing. He did a podcast a long time ago, I believe six months or so ago, where he used the N-word, and the way he used it is actually against white nationalists. And he also said a bunch of other stuff, and they decided, Patreon decided that what he said on a podcast was enough for them to remove him from the platform, even though he didn't do anything on their platform that was egregious. And, also, they had previously stated that they were only judging things that occurred on their platform."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: There's been a giant blow back because of that because people are saying, Well, now you're essentially policing, and not based on his actions, just on concepts and the communication that he was using, the way he was talking. You're eliminating him from being able to make a living, and that you're doing this because he does not fit into your political paradigm. The way you want to view the world, he views the world differently. This is an opportunity for you to eliminate someone who you disagree with."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, I don't know the nuances of their policy, but we have to pay attention to folks who are using Twitter to shut down the voices of others."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: That's where it gets weaponized. And we also have to pay attention to where people are using it that put other folks in physical danger. And that is where we need to be most severe. But, otherwise, everyone has a right to these technologies. And, I think, they also have a right to make sure that they have a very simple and open read of the rules. And we're not in a great state there. Our rules and our enforcement can be extremely confusing to people."
"[Joe Rogan]: What has been the one thing that came up that was perhaps the most controversial? Like I know my friend, Sam Harris, was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump and saying if you follow your Terms of Service-"
[INPUT]: I just did a podcast with him actually as well. It should come out today or tomorrow.
"[Joe Rogan]: He's a fascinating guy, Sam Harris. I love him to death. But what he was trying to do was like saying, Hey, he's threatening nuclear war. Like, he's saying, Hey, Korea, my bombs are bigger than your bombs. Like what else does the guy have to do to get you to remove him from the platform? When you guys saw that, what was your reaction to that? Was there an internal discussion about actually banning the President United States?"
"[INPUT]: Well, so, two things there. One, it was the context that presidents of this country have used similar language in different mediums. They used it on radio, they used it on television. It's not just through Twitter. And even if you were to look at the presidency of Obama, it wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language, but there were threats around the same country. And we have to take that context into consideration."
"[INPUT]: So, the second thing is that we need -- The most controversial aspect of our rules and our Terms of Service is probably this clause around public interest and newsworthiness, where powerful figures or public figures might be in violation of our Terms of Service, but the tweet itself is of public interest."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: There should be a conversation around it. And that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most and where we have a lot of internal debate. But we also have some pretty hard lines. If we had a global leader, including the President of United States, make a violent threat against a private individual, we would take action. We always have to balance that with like, Is this something that the public has interest in? And I believe, generally, the answer is yes. It's not going to be in every case but, generally, the answer is yes because we should see how our leaders think and how they act."
"[Joe Rogan]: And essentially, it all-"
[INPUT]: That informs voting. That informs the-
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: ... conversation. That informs whether we think they're doing the right job, or we think that they should be voted out."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's very important to see how someone uses that platform. And when someone uses it the way he uses it, and then becomes president, and continues to use it that way that's when people are like, What?"
"[INPUT]: He's been consistent. I think he joined in 2009, 2012."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: You look at all of his tweets all the way back then, and it's pretty consistent till today."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I mean, he likes to insult people on Twitter. It's fun for him."
"[INPUT]: Yes, he does."
"[Joe Rogan]: It's just I never thought he would keep doing it. I thought once he became president, maybe just lock it down, try to do a good job for the country. And then, after four years or eight years, just go back to his old self, Fuck you, fuck the world, fuck this, but no. He's just -- It's just, in one way, it's hilarious. See, as a comedian, I think it's awesome because it's so hilariously stupid. It's so preposterous that he even has the time to talk about Jeff Bezos' affair, and the fact that he got caught with the National Inquirer getting text messages and calls him Jeff Bozo like, Don't you have shit to do man?"
"[Joe Rogan]: But as a comedian, I am a gigantic fan of folly, almost against my better judgment. I like watching. I like watching disasters. I like watching chaos. When I see nonsense like that, I'm like, Oh Jesus. I'm drawn like a moth to a flame. But on the other part of me is like. Man, this sets a very bizarre tone for the entire country, because -- one of things about Obama, like Obama or hate Obama because he was very measured, very articulate, obviously, very well-educated. And I think that that aspect of his presidency was very good for all of us because he represented something that was of a very high standard in terms of his ability to communicate, his access to words, the way he measured his words, and held himself. I think that's good for us. Like yeah-"
[INPUT]: It's aspirational.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. It's like, Look at that guy. He's talking better than me, That's why he's the president. But when you see Trump, you're like, He doesn't talk better than me. He doesn't use Twitter better. He's not -- He's just this fucking mad man."
[INPUT]: But isn't it important to understand that-
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: ... and to see it-
[Joe Rogan]: Exactly.
"[INPUT]: ...and like to -- Hopefully, that informs opinions and actions."
"[Joe Rogan]: 100%. That's my point. That's my point is like that this is this weird gray area where I think, overall, I definitely support your decision to not ban him for violating your Terms of Service. Like we need to know."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: You know, and it's -- How do you know how many accounts are bots? How do you know how many accounts are from a Russian troll farm?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Like how do you know that?
"[INPUT]: So, this is really challenge and something that we're trying to wrap our heads around, but like one of the things we're trying to do is like let's scope that problem down a bit. Let's use the technology we have available to us, like face ID, like touch ID, like the biometric stuff to identify the humans. Let's identify the humans first."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, how do you use that because face ID not really available? Is it available to you guys? You just leaked something you shouldn't have told me?"
"[INPUT]: No, no, no, no. We haven't used it yet, but you can use it for things like, is this a human operating this?"
"[Joe Rogan]: It's like Apple Pay, you can use it for that, so."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's completely locked into the local device. We don't have access to your images, to your face, or whatnot, but the operating system can tell us that this is the legit owner of this phone; and therefore, it is human. And technology always has to change. People find ways around that and whatnot. But if we go the opposite direction, and we look for the bots, the problem with looking for the bots is people assume that they just come through our API, but the scripting has become extremely sophisticated. People can script the app, can script the website, and make it look very, very human."
"[INPUT]: So, we're going after this problem, first, trying to identify the humans as much as we can, utilizing these technologies. None of this is live right now. These are considerations that we're making and trying to understand, like what the impact would be and how we might evolve it. But we need to because that information would provide context for someone like this is an actual human that I'm talking to. And I can invest more time in it, or I can just ignore the thing because it's meaningless."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, is Apple willing to share that with you. I mean, when you're talking about biometrics, fingerprints, or face ID"
"[INPUT]: No, no, no. Not the data. It's just the operating system verifies that, you know, this-"
[Joe Rogan]: That there's individual user.
"[INPUT]: It's an individual, and it's unlocking."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Like, you know, when you use the -- Our Cash App uses this, right. So, Square's Cash App, when you want to make a transfer to someone, when you want to send someone money, or when you want to buy bitcoin, we turn on face ID, and you verify that you are you, and you are the owner of the phone, and then it goes. We don't get images of your face. We don't see who you are."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's what you want me to think. I know, yeah."
"[INPUT]: That's all locked down by the operating system, and that's the way it should be."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right, sure. Has there ever been any consideration to not allowing people to post anonymously?"
[INPUT]: Well-
"[Joe Rogan]: Like what you said earlier about journalists and whistleblowers, that is political."
"[INPUT]: So, look at platforms that have a real names policy. Look at Facebook."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Are the problems any different?
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't know because I don't go there, but for what I understand, there's a lot of -- still, a lot of arguing there."
[INPUT]: It's the same-
[Joe Rogan]: A lot of political arguing. A lot of old people.
"[INPUT]: They're the same vectors, the same patterns."
"[Joe Rogan]: I think, older. It's like older, in general."
"[INPUT]: It seems. I, also, am not really hanging out there, but it seems a little bit older."
"[Joe Rogan]: It's a lot of grannies looking at pictures of their kids, grandkids, and stuff."
[INPUT]: That's what it's made for. It's connecting-
[Joe Rogan]: Arguing about ignorance.
"[INPUT]: It's connecting with the people that you know. And that, to me, is the biggest difference with Twitter. It's connecting with the people you don't know-"
[Joe Rogan]: Well-
"[INPUT]: ... that you find interesting, and like it's around topics and stuff that you find that you want to learn more about."
"[Joe Rogan]: When you saw Zuckerberg testifying, and realizing like how this platform is being used, and what are the dangers of this, and then you see these senators that really don't know what the fuck the technology is or-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It really highlights how we're entering this-
[INPUT]: There's a gap.
"[Joe Rogan]: Really, yeah. Well, not just a gap. A gap and the critical understanding of how these things work, and what they are in terms of like how these really important politicians who are the ones who are making these decisions as to whether or not someone has violated laws, or whether or not something should be curbed or regulated."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: And they don't really even understand what they're talking about.
"[INPUT]: No. I mean, there's-"
[Joe Rogan]: So few people do.
[INPUT]: Because they're not using it directly. They're not using in the way that people are using it every single day and-
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: ... they don't have the same experience that people have every single day. And, you know, in terms of regulatory, and our regulators, and our governments, you know, I think the conversation is often about how regulators will come in, and start writing rules, and setting expectations for how companies or services might behave. But there's a role for the company to educate, and there's a role for the company to educate on like what technology makes possible, whether it'd be positive and also some of the negatives that become possible as well."
"[INPUT]: So, I think, we have a role to help educate and to help make sure that we're -- you know, really, we're pushing towards what I think the job of a regulator is, which is, number one, protect the individual; number two, level the playing field, and make sure that those two things are not compromised by special interests trying to protect their own domain, or profits, or dominance within a particular market."
[Joe Rogan]: What do you mean by level the playing field?
"[INPUT]: Level the playing field, so that an individual has the same opportunity that someone else might have our company might have."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, okay. So, like anybody-"
"[INPUT]: So, anyone-"
[Joe Rogan]: ... can have a Twitter account.
"[INPUT]: Anyone can have a Twitter account. And, you know, they have, at least, you know, an equal opportunity to contribute to it. And whatever they do with it will change the outcome. Some people might become very popular because they're saying stuff people want to hear. Some people won't see any following whatsoever because they're not adding anything original, or interesting, or different in terms of perspective."
"[Joe Rogan]: Where do you see this going? When you look at these, kind of, emerging technologies, not necessarily emerging anymore, established now, but still, you know, a new thing in relative terms of human history, where do you see this going? And does it get more intrusive? Does it get deeper into our lives? Like what -- And when you look at new technologies like augmented reality and things along those lines. do you see new possibilities and new things that make things even more complicated?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, yeah. I mean, we just have to assume that we naturally use more and more technologies, more and more things become open, more and more things increase the velocity. There's more communication, not less. Like this is not going away. And it's just-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: It's just a question of what we do with it. So, where I want it to go, and where I want Twitter specifically to go is, you know, I think, it's existential right now that we have global conversations about some things that will become crisis. Climate change being one of them. There's no one nation state that's going to solve that problem alone. Economic disparity being another, the rise of AI, and job displacement, and just like us offloading decisions to these algorithms."
"[INPUT]: Those are things that that no one nation, no one community is going to solve alone. It takes the entire world to do so. So, I want to make sure that we're doing our best to get people seeing these global conversations and, ideally, participating in them because it helps. It helps us solve the problems faster. I just believe that more open society allows us to solve problems much faster."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, you, in many ways, see Twitter as having some sort of a social responsibility in this discussion."
"[INPUT]: Totally, totally, totally. Yeah. And I think a big part of is like, right now, like how are we ensuring that there is more healthy contribution to that global conversation. And, you know, I just think it's so critical that we start talking about the things that are facing all of us, not just one nation. I do think that that's where our current model really puts the world at a disadvantage because it incentivizes more of the echo chambers, which lead to things like nationalism, instead of taking the broader picture, and looking at what's happening around the world to all people, to all of humanity."
"[Joe Rogan]: What do you do though to balance the conversation, or what responsibility do you think you have to balance a conversation in terms of the way conservatives view it versus the way liberals and progressives view it."
"[INPUT]: Balance it. I mean, show-"
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, is there a responsibility? Do you have a responsibility, or is it just leave it up to the people and let them figure it out, the same way they figured out hashtags and everything else?"
[INPUT]: I think we have a responsibility to make it easier to do that.
[Joe Rogan]: Easier. How so?
"[INPUT]: Right now, it's just too hard. Most people will not -- You know, have a sticker mindset."
[Joe Rogan]: Venture outside of their bubble.
[INPUT]: They will not venture out. They will not break their bubble.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But if you -- because it's -- Right now, on the surface, it's just so hard to do that. I can only follow accounts, and I have to look into and just imagine like, you know, trying to get an understanding of your own politics. People can't just look at your bio. They have to look through all your tweets, they have to listen to a bunch of your podcasts and whatnot. And that's a bunch of work. If we shift it more towards topics and interest, at least, we have the potential to see a bunch more perspectives. We see-"
[Joe Rogan]: How do you do that though?
"[INPUT]: The simplest thing is like follow a hashtag, follow a topic. Like why can't you just follow Warriors Twitter or, you know, NBA Twitter? Why do you have to go and find all the coaches, and the players, and the team."
[Joe Rogan]: So-
[INPUT]: We can do that. We can help make that a whole lot easier for folks.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, there's something like Brexit or something. So, if you go to #Brexit, you're going to get the whole conversation. You're going to get the pros, the cons, the left, the right, the whole deal, the centrists. You're going to get everybody versus following the people that you already follow that agree with what you think."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. The probability is higher that you'll get more. You'll get more variety of perspective. And not even -- Don't even follow Brexit. Follow Vote Leave if you want to leave. But within that topic, there might be some dissenting opinions. And you get to choose whether those inform you, whether that emboldens your position or not. And, again, I'm not saying that we should force that upon it, but it's not easy to even do that today, right. The only tool we give you is finding and following the accounts. And that-"
"[Joe Rogan]: But people search hashtags. They do search hashtags, right?"
[INPUT]: They don't based on the timeline.
[Joe Rogan]: They don't?
"[INPUT]: I mean, it is a small percentage of people. The people that really know Twitter know how to do that. But most people, they follow an account, and they stay in their timeline. And their world is their timeline."
"[Joe Rogan]: Hashtags can be corrupted too. I mean, people-"
"[INPUT]: Totally, they can be gamed."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: They can be gamed.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I-"
[INPUT]: And taken over.
[Joe Rogan]: I took over #vegancat. Go to #vegancat.
[INPUT]: What is that?
"[Joe Rogan]: It's a rap. That's mine now. In my last Netflix special about a woman who said a bunch of horrible things to me because I've put a picture up on Instagram of some deer meat. I wrote, This is a meat from a deer that like to kick babies. It was about to join ISIS. And I wrote #vegan, which was the mistake, right, to write #vegan. But the #vegan people went fucking crazy and came after me because I entered into their timeline with meat."
[INPUT]: There it is.
"[Joe Rogan]: Have you got a #vegancat? It's all either pictures of -- See. Like it says, Joe Rogan, right, Thank you. I haven't laughed that hard in a while #vegancat. It's people that are feeding their fucking cat vegan food, and they're all dying. And in the special, I say, Every cat looks like it's living in a house with a gas leak. Like they're all-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... like laying like, Where the fuck is the real food? But this is real. Like this-"
"[INPUT]: It generates conversation, different perspective."
"[Joe Rogan]: But the thing is if someone does something like that, like you can -- like pick a person, you know, whatever that person is, whatever they're doing, if they have a hashtag that they utilize all the time for their movement or whatever, someone could mock them, and then use that. And if it's a public figure or someone who's got a prominent voice, then, all of a sudden, that hashtag becomes -- People just take it over and start mocking them-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: ... with that hashtag.
[INPUT]: But it has to be done en masse.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: I mean, it has to be coordinated. And, sometimes, people like figure out how to game the system, and coordinate it, and amplify that message in an unfair way. And that's what our systems are trying to recognize."
[Joe Rogan]: How sick did that cat look?
[INPUT]: Amazing.
[Joe Rogan]: That poor fucking cat. That was a real one. That was a real #vegancat.
[INPUT]: Wow.
"[Joe Rogan]: These poor bastards. So, when you look back at emerging social media, like we go all the way back to MySpace, right. MySpace, you got Tom. Tom was sitting there, and you're in your top eight, and, you know, people would like post music that they liked, and it was never political. It was very -- often, very surfaced. And for comics, it was a great way to promote shows, and it was an interesting way to see things. But it was like the seed that became Twitter or Facebook or any of these."
"[INPUT]: That's one of them. I think, we -- At least, for us, like, we got more of our roots from AOL instant messenger and ICQ."
"[Joe Rogan]: Hmm, ICQ."
"[INPUT]: Because, it was -- You know, you remember the status message where you said like, I'm in a meeting, or I'm listening to this music, or I'm watching a movie right now."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[INPUT]: That was the inspiration.
[Joe Rogan]: Oh.
"[INPUT]: And what we took from that was being able to -- Like, if you could do that from anywhere, not bound to a desk, but you could do that from anywhere, and you could do it from your phone, and you could just be roaming around and say, you know, I'm at Joe Rogan's studio right now, that is cool. I don't need my computer. I'm not bound to this, chained to this desk. I can do it from anywhere."
"[INPUT]: And then, the other aspect of instant messenger was, of course, chat. So, one of the things that the status would do is you might say like, you know, I'm listening Kendrick Lamar right now, and I might hit you up on chat and say, like, What do you think of the new album? But, now, it's all public."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, it's just everyone can see it. That's the biggest difference. And that, to me, is what Twitter is, Myspace, it was profiles. And, you know, people organized around these profiles and this network that developed between people. And that is Facebook. Facebook optimized the hell out of that, and they scaled the world. We were something very different. You know, we started with a simple status. And then, people wanted to talk about it. And we decided that it should be on the same surface. It shouldn't be subservient to the status. It should be part of that flow. And that's what makes Twitter, you know, so fluid."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, when you look at this sort of metamorphosis or this evolution between those initial social media, whether it's AOL, Instant Messenger, that eventually became like ICQ, what was that one that we would use, that gamers would use, that it was like a livestream-"
[INPUT]: Search?
[Joe Rogan]: ... message board. No. It was like-
"[INPUT]: For a while, people were using TeamSpeak, but I don't know-"
"[Joe Rogan]: No, no, it wasn't. It wasn't that."
[INPUT]: ... if that's on your plan that's more recent.
"[Joe Rogan]: It wasn't that. It wasn't TeamSpeak. It was -- Like you would go there, and share files and stuff, and people would go -- Like if Ice play a lot of online video games-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And we play on teams, and we have teams go play other teams, and he would use this sort of -- It was like a -- It wasn't a message board because it was all in real time. What the fuck was it called?"
[INPUT]: OnLive?
[Joe Rogan]: No.
[INPUT]: No? Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: All right, forget it."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, sorry."
"[Joe Rogan]: Anyway, guys would go there, and you could send people files through it."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And, you know, teams would go and meet, and it would be a chat, like an online chat-"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: ... that would be in real time.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's -- I mean, we have a lot of our roots in AOL, Instant Messenger, but also like IRC, Internet Relay Chat and Usenet, which were, you know, these old internet '70s technology."
[Joe Rogan]: IRC is what I was talking about.
[INPUT]: IRC?
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. That's the one.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, okay, okay."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So, Internet Relay Chat is-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: ... like this giant chatroom that anyone can join. It's a range around topics. And-
[Joe Rogan]: That's -- What's interesting about that is you could see people typing. You see it occurring in real time. You see it popping up in real time.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: You know. Just I wonder like, what is the next evolution of this? Because no one saw anything going from ICQ to Twitter. No one saw anything going from that to Instagram, and to where we're at right now where it really does flavor the conversation of our entire culture. I mean, before, it was just a thing that was happening, that was happening on people's computers."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, it's a thing that's happening on people's computers. And, now, phones. And, now, your whole life. It's a very different influence."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And I wonder because everything does accelerate.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Things constantly move forward and become more and more integrated into our life experience. And I wonder, what is the next stage of this?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, like the secular trends, and, you know, you look at technology, and you look at technologies like blockchain, for instance, and I think, you know, we're moving to a world where anything created exists forever; that there's no centralized control over who sees what; that, you know, these models become completely decentralized, and all these barriers that exist today aren't as important anymore."
"[Joe Rogan]: When you think of something like gab, like gab seems to be a response to the fact that some people are getting banned from other platforms, and they're just allowing anybody to come on say and anything they want."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: The downside of that is, of course, the most horrible people are gonna be able to say anything they want with no repercussions. The good side is anybody can say whatever they want."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I haven't studied them too much, but I do know that they have taken action on accounts as well. They have suspended accounts. And they have-"
[Joe Rogan]: At what basis?
[INPUT]: ... a Terms of Service as well.
[Joe Rogan]: What do they suspend accounts for? Do you know?
"[INPUT]: I don't know. It's probably conduct-related. It's probably -- It might be doxxing, you know."
"[Joe Rogan]: Probably, right?"
"[INPUT]: But it's just a question of, like, you know, the rules. And if you agree to the rules, then, you know, you sign up for the service. And if not, there will be other services. But like you look at the trends, and I think, you know, certainly things become a lot more public, and certainly things become a lot more open. Certainly, the barriers and the boundaries that we have in place today become less meaningful. And I think there's a lot of positives in that. And I also think there's a lot of danger that we need to be mindful of."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, you, as a CEO, as a guy who's running this thing, what has this been, this experience been like for you? Because I've got to imagine that it wasn't anything that you predicted. No one predicted Twitter, right?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, to, all the sudden, have this responsibility-"
"[INPUT]: Twitter changed everything. I mean, it-"
[Joe Rogan]: And you're a young guy. How old are you?
[INPUT]: 42.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's young to be in control of that much, and to have it over the time of -- What has it been? 11 years?"
[INPUT]: 13 years.
[Joe Rogan]: 13 years.
"[INPUT]: We'll be 13 in March, yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. So, you were really fucking young."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Like what has that been like for you?
"[INPUT]: It's been both beautiful, and scary, and uncomfortable, and learning. It's just been a ton of learning and evolving. And like it it shows me every single day where I need to push myself what I don't know. And I think a big part is like just the realization that we're not gonna be able to do this alone. And I don't think we have to either. These are what the technologies that continue to allow us."
"[INPUT]: We can -- If we have to have all the answers around enforcement or policy, we're not going to serve the world. We have aspirations to serve every single person on the planet, and we have aspirations to be the first consideration for the global public conversation. And, you know, if we're the bottleneck for all of this, we're not going to reach those aspirations. So, it's just thinking deeply about how we might distribute more of this work, and decentralize more of it, and look at, you know, the platform itself, and like what we need to change to reach that reality."
"[INPUT]: And I think we've got to look really deep and foundational. It goes back to, you know, your question on 140. One of the things that we saw was, you know, we shifted to 280 characters, and that -- You know, this 140-characters is so sacred, you know."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It became this cultural thing. And I was in love with it, and so many people are in love with it. But one of the things we noticed as we moved to 280 is that the vast majority of tweets that are broadcast don't go above 140, even with that limitation raised. But where they do go above 140 is in replies. When people reply, they tend to go over 140-character limit, and even bump up into the 280 limit."
"[INPUT]: And what it allowed -- What we've seen it allow is just more nuance in the conversation. It allows people to give more context and kind of just get their experience on the table a bit more; whereas, 140 did not allow that. So, we have seen that increase, the health of those conversations and the discussion. So, it's stuff like that that we need to question and not hold so sacred."
[Joe Rogan]: Is there any consideration to expanding it further?
[INPUT]: Not right now. We were-.
[Joe Rogan]: How about a million characters? No?
"[INPUT]: Well, we don't have edit tweets right now. So, we-"
[Joe Rogan]: Do you think that that's good or bad?
"[INPUT]: Well, if you can't edit 140 characters, you're going to be really pissed off if you write a million characters in kind of those things."
"[Joe Rogan]: You know what I would like? I would like edit, the ability to edit like if you make a typo or something like that, but also the ability for people to see the original."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Like edit but see the original.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Like say if it is-
[INPUT]: We're looking at exactly that.
[Joe Rogan]: Oh really?
"[INPUT]: We're looking at exactly that. The reason we don't have it in the first place is we were born on SMS. We're born on text messaging. When you send a text, you can't take it back."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, when you send a tweet, it goes to the world instantaneously."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You can't take it back. So, when we-"
"[Joe Rogan]: But does not exist anyway. I mean, no matter what, if you send someone something even, if you -- on Instagram, people are gonna know the original."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, they screenshot it, and they-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: You know, they do their thing. But like you could build it such that, you know, maybe we introduce a five-second to 30-second delay in the sending. And within that window, you can edit."
"[Joe Rogan]: I'm gonna need more time than I do. If I fuck something up, like someone has to tell me."
[INPUT]: But the-
"[Joe Rogan]: Hey, man, you misspelled that word. Shit, did I? God damn it."
[INPUT]: The issue-
"[Joe Rogan]: But sometimes, autocorrect gets you."
"[INPUT]: Totally. But the issue with going longer than that, it takes that real time nature and the conversational flow out of it."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: So, then, we're delaying these tweets. And like when you're watching UFC or you're watching like Warriors basketball, a lot of the great Twitter is like just like in the moment. Just like, you know, it's the roar of the crowd. It's like, you know, looking across at someone you're in this virtual stadium with, and just saying like, Oh my god, that shot. Can you believe it? And-"
[Joe Rogan]: But isn't clarity more important because you're not going to-
[INPUT]: It depends on the context.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It depends on the context.
[Joe Rogan]: But you're still gonna have the ability to communicate quickly.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: But you also have the ability to clarify.
"[INPUT]: That's where we need to really pay attention because if you're in the context of an NBA game, you want to be fast, and you just want to be at the moment, and you just -- You know, you want to be raw. But if you're in the context of considering what the president just did or making a particular statement, then you probably need some more time. And we can be dynamic there."
"[Joe Rogan]: What's interesting to me is how few people use video. Like I thought when you guys have video on Twitter, I'm like, Well, a bunch people are gonna be making videos and putting those up on Twitter. And it's not. It's not that often."
[INPUT]: It depends on who you follow. It's huge for some aspects of Twitter. It's-
[Joe Rogan]: Is it?
[INPUT]: It's less so in others but-
[Joe Rogan]: What aspects is huge for?
"[INPUT]: A lot of sports. I mean, we see a lot of like just the replays and the recaps and like-"
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, for sure, yeah."
"[INPUT]: You know, aspects of a particular shot that people want to comment on. I don't like -- I think it's dangerous for us to focus too much on the medium, whether it'd be images, or GIFs, or video. It's more about the conversation around it. Like that's what we want optimized for."
"[Joe Rogan]: It's definitely very popular for sports, and in a folly, and, you know, there's a -- What is a -- There's a bunch of animal attack videos that you can-"
[INPUT]: Nature is Metal.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, Nature is Metal is a good one and Hold my Beer. That's another good one. I mean, it's all videos. But what I meant was people making a video, talking about something."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: This is what I was trying to say. What I think is this and that, blah, blah, blah. You don't see a lot of that. And I thought maybe that would be something that people would adopt more."
"[INPUT]: To a different speed, you know. And I think, like the consumption of video, I mean, you see this in the technology right now. Like people are subtitling every single video because people might be in an environment where they can't turn the audio on, or, like, a video, like I have to scrub through to see what's interesting."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: With text, I can just see it. And it allows for a lot of serendipity to find something that I probably wouldn't have seen unless I watched the whole damn video. So, like the ability to clip something, the ability to like index in, I think, is really critical. So, it's not -- To me, it's not about the format. It's about the use case and the context that you're in."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, going back to the responsibility that you guys have, and you in particular, like when this became what it is now, and when it became evident that it became this gigantic way of changing the way human beings communicate with each other, was there ever any regret, or was there ever a moment where you're like, What the fuck have I gotten myself into?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, there's -- I'm always reflective of where I am and what I'm doing. I think that the biggest has been around -- Twofold. One, how the dynamics of the service allow it to be weaponized in order to silence someone else or to drive them off the surface entirely, which goes against the entire concept of free speech and free participation. Like we just can't stand for that. We need to make sure that everyone feels that they have an opportunity at a voice. And when you have these coordinated attacks, it's just it's not fair."
"[INPUT]: Second is around, you know, this concept of an echo chamber and the filter bubble. I just -- I don't feel personally good about that. I don't feel that we thought that through enough in the early days. I think we should have moved towards biasing the service towards topics and interests much, much sooner than we're now considering doing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, when you have these considerations, when you take these actions, do you consult with psychologists, or sociologists, or historians, or people to try to put in perspective for you what the ramifications of each individual move would be?"
[INPUT]: I try to read as much as possible. I try to talk to as many people as possible. Just get a completely different perspective and-
[Joe Rogan]: Is there any internal disagreement about actions that you take?
"[INPUT]: Oh yeah. There's always debate. There's always debate. But, I think, my role is to ask ask questions and make sure, like, what is our goal here? What are we trying to do? You know-"
[Joe Rogan]: And that evolves?
"[INPUT]: That evolves, that evolves. Like, is this, over the long term, going to be a net positive for all humans, all humanity? Like, how do we balance the considerations of, you know, how we serve everyone? And, like, how do we get down to something? How do we get down to a fundamental answer and a central answer? And that, to me, is where the real truth is, is when you can get to something foundational. But, you know, I like having conversations with as many people from as many different fields as possible and getting the perspective on it. So, I ask questions all the time."
"[Joe Rogan]: It's interesting the way you're phrasing this too that you are looking at this as a method to save, or to help people, to serve people. You're looking at this as a way that you can benefit society, that society can benefit from your platform, can benefit from this ability to communicate. You're not just looking at it as a tech company that has to remain profitable. And that is-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: One of the more interesting things about tech companies, to me -- I mean, there's been a lot of criticism, maybe justified in some ways, that tech companies all lean left. But what is interesting to me is that name another corporation that willingly, of its own choice, takes that into consideration that they want to serve the world and serve culture in a beneficial way regardless of profit."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, because you're not really selling anything, right. You guys have a platform. Obviously, it's financially viable, but you're not selling things, right?"
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, we do our models based off people's attention."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And they're paying us with their attention. And that's extremely valuable, and something that we need to really, really honor. But I agree with you. I mean, look at Tesla. You know, I just listened to the recent earnings call. And one of the things that Elon said was, Look, there are two reasons for Tesla. Number one is to advance, you know, different sources of energy and more renewable sources of energy because it's a fundamental and existential crisis that's facing all humanity. And number two is to advance autonomy because it'll save lives and give people time back."
"[INPUT]: And then, you start talking about how to make that possible. And that's where, you know, our business comes in. How do we make that possible? And we have a great business. We need to improve a bunch of it, but it serves what we think our larger purpose is, which is serving the public conversation. We want to see more global public conversations. We want our technology to be used to make the world feel a lot smaller, to help see what common problems we have before us, and, ideally, you know, how we can get people together to solve them faster and solve them better."
[Joe Rogan]: You also seem to be embracing this responsibility that you're helping to evolve culture. And this is part of providing this method to communication -- of communication rather. It's helping to evolve culture. And this is something that is really only applicable to tech companies in some strange way. And it's weird that so many of them share this.
[Joe Rogan]: Like I was personally a little weirded out when Google took out Don't Be Evil. Like that was a big part of their operating model.
[INPUT]: Did they take that out?
[Joe Rogan]: Yes. Yes. Right?
[INPUT]: Mmhmm.
[Joe Rogan]: Make sure. I don't want to get sued. Pretty sure they removed that from what would -- What do you call that? Their operational directive? What is-
[INPUT]: It's in the code of conduct.
"[INPUT]: Code of conduct. And it's not there anymore, right? They removed it."
"[INPUT]: So, yeah. The other article says they removed the clause."
[Joe Rogan]: And this-
[INPUT]: It's kind of a weird thing to tell people not to be evil.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's weird that they take it out. Once you already said it, it's way weirder to say, Yeah, fuck it. We were wrong. Just go ahead."
[INPUT]: There's another way of saying that though.
"[INPUT]: They changed it to, Do the right thing."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh. Well, what does that mean? What the fuck does do the right thing mean? Do the right thing, so you can make more money? You know, like, Hey, we want to make money. We'll do the right thing. It's makes more money.."
"[INPUT]: I mean, that's why -- Like, that's why this openness is so critical. I mean, that's why-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Like the public -- To me, the public conversation is so important. We can talk about stuff like that."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: And there will be companies forming today that look at objectives and mandates like that and base their whole culture around it. And is that the right idea?
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's-"
"[INPUT]: I don't know. But if we're not talking about it, we won't be able to answer that question."
"[Joe Rogan]: What's also interesting because Google is so all encompassing, right. You have Gmail, you have Android. I mean, that -- They are the number one operating system for mobile phones in the world on top of being a search engine. There's so much involved in that company. And, again, like almost all tech companies, they heavily lean left, and they -- Because they had that Don't Be Evil as a part of their code of conduct, it seemed like something that was a good idea to have."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And it, sort of, defined what I was talking about that tech companies are uniquely progressive."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what makes that. I think, no matter what, like, we -- The internet allows for a very healthy skepticism of nearly everything."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: I'm from Missouri. It's a Show-Me State.
[Joe Rogan]: Are you really from Missouri?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. We're all skeptics. My mom was a Democrat. My dad was a Republican. My dad listened to Rush Limbaugh and Hannity all the time. I found myself somewhere in the middle. But one of the things I appreciated, we had a ton of fights, and arguments, and yelling matches around the kitchen table. But, like, I appreciate the fact that we could have them. And I felt safe to do so. And I didn't feel like -- I mean, obviously, they're my parents, but they weren't judging me because of what I said, and-"
[Joe Rogan]: They didn't force you to be a Republican or a Democrat.
"[INPUT]: Didn't force me to think a particular way. Like, I think they were good, at least, showing different perspectives even in this union that they have. And I don't know. It developed a skepticism in me that I think is healthy, and I have a lot of skepticism of companies like ours and leaders like me. I think that's right. I think that's right, and people should. And we -- I mean, I was formed through a lot of the ideals. I think I just fell in love with what it made possible."
"[INPUT]: And I never ever want to run afoul of those ideals. And, you know, the removal of barriers, and boundaries, and the connection that we have because of it. And, you know, I think often and reflect often about my role and the centralization of my role in our company, and I want to figure out and help figure out, like, how we can continue to add massive value and be an amazing business, which is us and will always be us."
"[INPUT]: But at the same time, be a participatory force in this greater good that the internet has really started. And it's not led by any one individual or any one company. And that's the beauty of it. And I want to make sure that we find our place in that, and we can also contribute massively to it. And I think we can. It's just going to take a lot of work, a lot of introspection, and a lot of experimentation. A lot of making mistakes and failures too."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, and it's very encouraging that you have that attitude because, you know, a lot of people, I think, in a similar situation would try to control the narrative. They would try to reinforce their own particular perspective on things and try to get other people to adopt it or try to push it. And I think it's very important-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: ... to just have this open discussion. And I think it's very important to review your own thoughts and ideas.
[INPUT]: Totally.
[Joe Rogan]: And one of the best ways to do so is through the-
[INPUT]: Put it out there.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, put it out there."
[INPUT]: Put it out there and have other people review it.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Peer review is a great process. And the-
[Joe Rogan]: That was the way this podcast has evolved more than probably anything.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. That's the thing. I mean, you did this because you want to learn from people. And the platform that you've created, millions get to learn from it as well."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And that's just so amazing. Like I learn from your podcast all the time. And that's what technology makes possible. But with that power also comes ramifications. And if we're not talking about the ramifications and, like, at least, being open about what we know and what we don't know. And, I think, we're -- I think we state and post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't know."
[Joe Rogan]: Why don't you guys-
[INPUT]: And that's just so interesting.
"[Joe Rogan]: Why don't you guys steal Don't Be Evil? Put that in your own shit. Fuck you, Google."
"[INPUT]: I don't know if that's going to help anything. Then, what is that telling our employees to do?"
[Joe Rogan]: Don't be evil. It's real simple. Don't be a dick.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, how do we get deeper in just, like, seeing more conversation around what is evil."
"[Joe Rogan]: Have you guys considered expanding your influence in other venues? Like, you know, Google started off as a search engine. Now, it's fucking everything. Have you guys considered doing something similar?"
"[INPUT]: I think, we probably did too much of that early on. And that's what led to a bunch of issues from a corporate standpoint. We're just trying to do too much too many times."
[Joe Rogan]: Like what?
"[INPUT]: I don't know. We're trying to be everything to everyone. And like, you know, we had, you know, a video thing, and we had -- We're looking at gaming stuff and messaging. And it lost focus of what we are good at. What we're good at is conversation, and what we're good at is public conversation. So, we now have -- As a company where, we have just such an amazing focus on what that means and how that evolves."
"[INPUT]: And there's just -- There's some really cool things that we can do there. Like we have this app called Periscope. And one of the things that we're discovering is, like, a lot of people are using it to podcast. A lot of people are using it to share their thoughts, and these people come in, and, you know, they chat, and have a conversation. And one of the things we did recently is we allowed the audio to play in the background. It's super simple, but what we found was that people didn't necessarily want to watch the video of people talking. They just want to hear what they're saying. And that just opened the door for more types of use cases."
"[INPUT]: And there's some really exciting things coming out with Periscope that, I think, add a new dimension to what conversation looks like, and how it is experienced, and how it evolves. And those are the things I get really excited about. It's like, how can we make conversation better? And, you know, how do we make it feel more live? How do we make it feel more electric? And how do we bring new technology into it that just opens a door for an entirely new way of talking?"
"[INPUT]: And that's the thing that I think has been most educational to me about Twitter is, you know, as we talked about, we started with this idea of sharing what was happening around you. And then, people told us what they wanted to wanted it to be, and it became this conversational medium. It became this interest network. And it became a thing that was entirely new. And, you know, we observed it, and we learned more and more of what it wanted to be in. And as we get deeper and deeper that we're going to be surprised by some of the technologies that we thought would be used in this way, but it turns out that the massive use case, and the resonant use case, and the fundamental use case is going to be created right before our eyes by the people using it."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, did you guys acquire Periscope or was-"
"[INPUT]: We acquired Periscope, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: And what was the thought process when you were acquiring it?
[INPUT]: We like the live nature of it. We like the broadcast aspect.
[Joe Rogan]: Why keep it as Periscope? Why not have it be like Twitter Live?
[INPUT]: There's a specific community on Periscope. And I think it's interesting from an experimentation standpoint. We can play with ideas there. It's a smart playground.
"[Joe Rogan]: Scott Evans, I think, uses it better than anybody. He gets on it-"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, he's really good at it."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And he's one that I think has figured out just the knack behind it. You know, he starts every one of them with this simultaneous sip of coffee."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So, he gets his listeners and his viewers engaged right away. And then, he just goes on. And then, every now and then, he'll, you know, look at the comments, and riff off them. So-"
"[Joe Rogan]: He lets people build up too. Like, he'll announce that he's going on, and then wait a little while, say hello to some people."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Then, once a bunch of people are in the room, then he starts talking."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And I just -- I find that so interesting because that is the future of conversation. It's looking at the patterns. It's looking at what people are trying to do with the thing. And then, you build technology around it. And that becomes the next big thing. And we just have to -- We have to hone our power of observation, hone our power of, like, connecting the dots, and looking at all the patterns, and what people are -- It's what's the question behind the question? What's the statement behind the statement that they're making? And if we can get good at understanding some of those fundamental central things, then we've reached -- We've, at least, created the probability that most people in the world will find it useful and find it valuable."
"[Joe Rogan]: Joey Diaz as the other person that uses Periscope better than anybody live, but he just gets on."
[INPUT]: I haven't seen his.
[Joe Rogan]: He just gets baked. It gives you a morning -- What does he call it? Morning Band Head?
[INPUT]: The Morning Joint.
"[Joe Rogan]: The Morning Joint, yeah. He'll smoke a joint or smoke a bowl in the morning, and then just sort of let everybody know-"
[INPUT]: Doing something-.
[Joe Rogan]: ... what's mine is mine.
[INPUT]: Doing something in sync with one -- with more people is interesting. Like we've had some folks who are interested in doing meditations through Periscope.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, that's a great idea."
"[INPUT]: You can -- I mean, if you look at the surface level, you can't imagine anything more boring than like watching someone meditate. But if you're actually meditating with them, there's something powerful about it. And, like, what can we do to improve that experience?"
[Joe Rogan]: What about people using it for group workouts? Is anyone doing that?
"[INPUT]: I'm sure it's happened, and I haven't seen it personally, but I'm sure it's happening."
[Joe Rogan]: How much more people do you have on Twitter than Periscope?
[INPUT]: A lot.
"[Joe Rogan]: A lot more, huh?"
"[INPUT]: A lot. It's one of those things that I, personally, just have a lot of conviction around, and I have a lot of belief in the format, and I -- You know, every now and then, we don't have instant hits. It just requires a lot of patience. And we need to really learn what it wants to be. And, sometimes, that takes time. And, you know, I think, oftentimes, I've certainly done this, you know, we shut down things a little bit too early."
"[INPUT]: We did this at Square. Like we had this amazing technology, an app I love called Square Wallet. And it allowed you to -- You know, you link your credit card, and you have all these merchants around you here in LA, and you could walk up to a coffee merchant. And as you walked up, your name would pop up on the register, so you could say like, I want a cappuccino. Put it on Jack. And it just automatically charge your card. And it would only happen if you were within, like, two feet. We're using Bluetooth, and geolocation, and whatnot."
"[INPUT]: But, you know, we had it for about three years, and it just didn't take off, and we shut it down. And I kind of regret doing that, but it also paved the way for another thing that I didn't want to give up on, and that was the Cash App. Like for four years, it was just a slug. Like a lot of people in the company wanted to shut down the thing. They saw it as something that wasn't successful. And, you know, recently the team reached number one in the App Store in the United States."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Like, we are all -- We are against all these incumbents like Venmo, and PayPal, and it finally clicked. And it's just because we have the patience and the conviction around our belief."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it's a great app too. And the ethics behind it are really fantastic too. We're really thankful for the Cash App, especially my friend, Justin Rand, and his fight for the forgotten charity that every time you use the code word, joerogan, all one word, it all goes-"
[INPUT]: We match it.
[Joe Rogan]: $5 goes to that. And they've built two wells for the pygmies in the Congo.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And they've raised thousands of dollars in building more wells right now. It's really, really cool."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: We're really, really happy about that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. I love it. I think it's-"
"[Joe Rogan]: It's a great way to save money too. I mean, when you can save 10% at Whole Foods-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, that's real."
"[INPUT]: Well, the other thing is like the population that we serve, typically, are underserved by banks or unbanked entirely."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Today, we are their bank account."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But more importantly, they don't have access to things like rewards. You don't get rewards on a typical debit card or credit card."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, like, just, you know, going to your favorite place and getting an instant 10% off, or whatever it is, is out of reach for most people because the financial institutions don't enable that, and they won't even enable them to get in the door in the first place."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, if people were listening to this on YouTube, you don't know what the fuck we're talking about, the Cash App has a thing called the Cash Card, which is a debit card that you get with it, and there's a thing called Boost. And with Boosts, all you do is pick a boost in the app, and then use your cash card as a debit card, and you get these automatic discounts. And they're real discounts."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And in this-.
"[INPUT]: Instant, instant."
"[Joe Rogan]: For folks with bad credit, there's no credit check. You can direct deposit your paycheck right into the app. And the fact that you guys do things like support Fight for the Forgotten, and you're supporting UFC Fighter Ray Bourque's son who's got some serious medical bills-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... it's really, really cool."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. I'm really proud of that. I'm really proud of the team. It's a very small team, but they're doing some big things."
"[Joe Rogan]: I hear a lot of good things about it too. I've run into people on the street that tell me they use it, and they're very happy about it."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it's nice to see, again, an emerging technology that's profitable, but, yet, also, has a really good set of ethics."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you have Don't be Evil in Cash App's code of honor?
"[INPUT]: No, no, no."
[Joe Rogan]: Maybe you should not take it. It's free now.
"[INPUT]: One of our equivalent operating principles within Cash and Square is like under -- like, how do we understand someone's struggle? Like, how do we understand? Like, how do we have empathy for like what they're struggling with? And, like, when it comes to finance, they're struggling with a lot."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Typically, they're struggling with the ton."
"[Joe Rogan]: What was the thought process with -- I mean, one of the things that's kind of cool about the Cash App is that you can buy and sell bitcoin with it."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Are you guys going to consider other forms or cryptocurrency as well?
"[INPUT]: Not right now. So, back to the internet, I believe the internet will have a native currency."
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
"[INPUT]: It will have a native currency. And I don't know if it's Bitcoin. And I think it will because just given all the tests it's been through, and the principles behind it, how it is created. And, you know, it was something that was born on the internet, that was developed on the internet, that it was tested on the internet. It is of the internet."
"[INPUT]: And the reason, you know, we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin within the Cash App is, one, we want to learn about the technology, and we want to put ourselves out there, and take some risk. We're the first publicly-traded company to actually offer it as a service. We're the first publicly-traded company to talk to the FCC about bitcoin, and what that means. And it made us uncomfortable. We had to, you know, like really understand what was going on. And that was critical and important."
"[INPUT]: And then, the second thing is that, you know, we would love to see something become a global currency. It enables more access. It allows us to serve more people. It allows us to move much faster around the world. And we thought we were going to start with how you can use it transactionally, but we noticed that people were treating it more like an asset, like a virtual gold. And we wanted to just to make that easy. Like, just the simplest way to buy and sell bitcoin. But we also knew that it had to come with a lot of education. It had to come with constraint because, you know, two years ago, people did some really unhealthy things about, you know, purchasing bitcoin. They maxed out their credit cards and put all their life savings into the bitcoin."
"[INPUT]: So, we developed some very simple restrictions and constraints, like you can't buy Bitcoin on the Cash App with a credit card. You have to -- It has to be the money you actually have in it. And we look for day trading, which we discouraged and shut down. Like that's not what we are trying to build. That's not what we are trying to optimize for. We made a children's book explaining what bitcoin is, and where it came from, and how people use it, and where it might be going. So, we really tried to take on the role of education and have some like very simple healthy constraints that allowed people to consider what their actions are in the space."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, when you have something like the Cash App, which it's very much a disruptive technology in terms of, like, decentralization of banks and currency. And, you know, to have it where everything is going right -- You're direct depositing a paycheck right in the app if you so choose. Then, you could also buy Bitcoin, which is another disruptive technology. I mean, that -- This is another step towards this sort of new way of doing things now."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And is there pushback from any companies or is there-
"[INPUT]: Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, like, you just look at, like, some of the major banks and their consideration around Bitcoin. They all love blockchain because of the efficiencies it can create for their business and potentially new business lines. But, you know, I think, there is a-."
[Joe Rogan]: Explain blockchain for people who don't know what we're talking about.
"[INPUT]: Blockchain is a distributed ledger. And what that means is that it's, basically, a distributed database where, you know, the source of truth can be verified at any point around the network. And you can see, you know, this annotation around how content or how around money, like, traveled."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, you don't have to go to an institution to get them?"
"[INPUT]: So, the records, yeah, there's no centralized check. There's no a centralized control over it. And I think that is threatening. It's certainly threatening to certain services behind banks and financial institutions. It's threatening to some governments as well. So, I just look at this and, like, how do we embrace this technology, not react to it, you know, more from a threat standpoint, but, like, what does it enable us to do, and where does our value shift?"
"[INPUT]: And that's what we should be talking about right now is like how our value shifts. And there's always really strong answers to that question. But if you're not willing to ask the question in the first place, you will become irrelevant because technology will just continue to march on and make you irrelevant. And it's the people that like are, you know, growing up with this technology, or born with the technology, only knowing that technology, or are asking the tough questions of themselves that are going to be super disruptive to their business, and they're thinking about right now, and they're taking actions."
"[INPUT]: And, you know, we're doing that at Square, and we're doing that at Twitter. And like that, to me, represents longevity. That represents our ability to thrive. And we got to push ourselves, we got to make ourselves uncomfortable, and we've got to disrupt what we held sacred, and what we think is success because, otherwise, it's not going to be bigger than what we have today."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And I think that cryptocurrency, to me, represents one of the more interesting discussions on the internet lately."
[INPUT]: Totally.
[Joe Rogan]: What is money?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And why are we agreeing that it's these pieces of paper that the Federal Reserve prints out?
"[INPUT]: Totally. It's a fascinating time in technology because, like, that, to me, was one of the last, big, centralized nationalized instruments is currency, is money. And when you think about the internet as a country, as a market, as a nation, it's going to have its own currency. But what's interesting about the internet as a nation, it's the whole world. It is the whole world. So, the world gets one currency. It gets one thing they communicate in. And that, to me, is just so freeing and so exciting."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I'm very excited by it. And I'm also very excited at the fact that it's only been around for such a short period of time but-"
[INPUT]: 10 years.
[Joe Rogan]: And it's become a part of the global conversation.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's like a good brand."
[Joe Rogan]: I also think that it's going to open up the door to potential universal languages. And I think this is-
[INPUT]: Totally.
[Joe Rogan]: This is-
[INPUT]: Totally.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that excites me a lot about Twitter is like, how do we -- Like it -- If we want to get the world into a conversation, not a single conversation but, at least, being able to see that global conversation, like we've got to work on technologies that would like instantly translate."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: We got to work on technologies that I can speak as I'm speaking right now. And in real time, people are hearing it in their context, in their language, in their dialect. That is amazing. That is so exciting."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And like just how that evolves, and how it impacts, not just communication like this but music. And just like, you know, how hip hop, and rap, and, you know, just -- It just -- It's amazing to think about where that can go and where that can take us."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And I think you and I are extremely fortunate to be alive right now during this time because, I think, it's one of the strangest and most unique times-"
[INPUT]: Totally
[Joe Rogan]: ... in human history.
[INPUT]: Totally.
"[Joe Rogan]: I don't think there's ever been a time where things have changed so radically, so quickly."
"[INPUT]: Totally. Yeah. And I feel, you know, we're just -- We're able through technologies like Twitter to, at least, see and acknowledge some of the issues that we're still facing that we're probably in the dark before. And I think that's so critical to making any sort of improvements for making any sort of evolution and for making it better for everyone on the planet."
"[INPUT]: And, you know, as uncomfortable as, you know, sometimes Twitter makes people feel, I think it is necessary to see those things and have conversations about them, so that we can understand how we might move forward and how we might really get at the biggest problems facing us all. And, you know, there's some huge ones, some huge ones right now that if we don't have -- if we don't talk about it, like, it will drive us to extinction, and like it will threaten our ability to be in a planet, to live on this planet."
[Joe Rogan]: I agree. Thank you.
[INPUT]: Thanks again.
"[Joe Rogan]: Thanks for everything, man. Thanks for being here."
[INPUT]: Thank you.
"[Joe Rogan]: Thanks for doing what you're doing. Thanks for having the attitude that you have. I really, really appreciate."
[INPUT]: Thank you. Joe.
"[INPUT]: And then, I'm a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs. And, like, the kids love that one. That's the line when he pulls up the flamethrower. It's like, We should do a flamethrower. So, we-"
"[Joe Rogan]: Does anybody tell you no? Does anybody go, Elon, maybe for yourself, but selling a flamethrower, the liabilities, all the people you're selling this device to, what kind of unhinged people are going to be buying a flamethrower in the first place? Do we really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's a terrible idea. It's terrible. Don't buy one. I said, Don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it. Don't buy it. That's what I said, but, still, people bought it."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: There's nothing I can do to stop them. I did not stop them.
"[Joe Rogan]: You build it, they will come."
"[INPUT]: I said, Don't buy it. It's a bad idea."
[Joe Rogan]: How many did you make?
"[INPUT]: It's dangerous. It's wrong. Don't buy it. And, still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them."
[Joe Rogan]: How many did you make?
"[INPUT]: 20,000."
[Joe Rogan]: And they're all gone?
"[INPUT]: In three -- I think, four days. They sold out in four days."
[Joe Rogan]: Are you going to do another run?
[INPUT]: No.
"[Joe Rogan]: No, that's it?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, I see."
"[INPUT]: I said we're doing 20. We did 50,000. 50,000 hats, and that was a million dollars. I thought, Okay. Well, we'll sell something for 10 million, and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each. They went fast."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. How do you have the time? How do you have the time to do that though? I mean, I understand that it's not a big deal in terms of all the other things you do, but how do you have time to do anything? I just -- I don't understand your time management skills."
"[INPUT]: I mean, I didn't spend much time on this flamethrower. I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover. It's not a real flamethrower."
"[Joe Rogan]: Which is why it says, Not a flamethrower."
"[INPUT]: That's why we were very clear, this is not actually a flamethrower. And, also, we are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers. So, we're very -- To solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labeled it, Not a flamethrower."
[Joe Rogan]: Did it work? Was it effective?
[INPUT]: I don't know. I think so. Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: So far.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, but you do-"
[INPUT]: Because they said you cannot ship a flamethrower.
"[Joe Rogan]: But you do so many different things. Forget about the flamethrower. Like, how do you do all that other shit? Like, how does one decide to fix LA traffic by drilling holes in the ground? And who do you even approach with that? Like, when you have this idea, who do you talk to about that?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be successful or something, you know. It's not like asserting that it's going to be successful. But so far, I've lived in LA for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible. And so, I don't see any other, like, ideas for improving the traffic. So, in desperation, we're going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful and maybe it won't."
[Joe Rogan]: I'm listening.
[INPUT]: Yeah. I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work.
[Joe Rogan]: And are the people that you-
"[INPUT]: I mean, or anyone."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you are starting this though. This is actually a project you're starting to implement, right."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah, no. We've dug about a mile. It's quite long. It takes a long time to walk it."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Now, when you're doing this, what is the ultimate plan? The ultimate plan is to have these in major cities, and anywhere there's mass congestion, and just try it out in LA first?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. It's in LA because I mostly live in LA. That's the reason. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places to dig tunnels mostly because of the paperwork. You all think it's like, What about seismic? It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes."
[Joe Rogan]: Why is that?
"[INPUT]: Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So, if there's a storm, you want to be in a submarine. So, being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals."
"[INPUT]: And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it doesn't crack or break. And it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it's capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, when you have this idea, who do you bring this to?"
[INPUT]: I'm not sure what you mean by that.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, you're implementing it. So, you're digging holes in the ground."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like, you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it."
"[INPUT]: Yes. There are some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this. And the guy who runs it, like, day-to-day is Steve Davis. He's a longtime SpaceX engineer. He is great. So, Steve was like, I'd like to help make this happen. I was like, Cool. So, we started off with digging a hole in the ground. It's got like a permit for a pit, like pit, and just dug a big pit."
"[Joe Rogan]: And you have to tell them what the pit's for, or you just said, Hey, we just want to dig a hole."
[INPUT]: I just filled up this form.
[Joe Rogan]: That's it?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it was a pit in our parking lot."
"[Joe Rogan]: But do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea? And do they have to approve it? Like, how does that work?"
[INPUT]: Now. We just started off with a pit.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: A big pit. And, you know, it's not really -- You know, they don't really care about the existential nature of a pit. You just say like, I want a pit."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And it's a hole in the ground. So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three days, two to three days. Actually, I think two, 48 hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype. He's going to attend the Hyperloop Competition. which is like a student competition we have for who can make the fastest part in the Hyperloop. And he was coming."
"[INPUT]: The finals are going to be on Sunday afternoon. And so, Eric is coming by on Sunday afternoon. He's like, You know, we should dig this pit, and then like show Eric. So, this was like Friday morning. And then, yeah. So, it's about a little over 48 hours later, we dug the pit. There was like wind 24/7. Oh, 24. 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we're like, Show Eric the pit. It's like, obviously, it's just a pit. But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground."
"[Joe Rogan]: And what did you tell him about this pit? I mean, you just said this is the beginning of this idea."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: We're going to build tunnels under LA to help funnel traffic better.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And they just go, Okay. But we've joked around about this in the podcast before to like what if a person can go to the people that run the city and go, Hey, I want to dig some holes on the ground and put some tunnels in there, and they go Oh, yeah, okay."
[INPUT]: Not the only one with a hole in the ground.
[Joe Rogan]: But it's a-
[INPUT]: People dig holes in the ground all time.
"[Joe Rogan]: But my question is, like, I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory. I know how much time you must be spending on SpaceX. And yet, you still have time to dig holes under the ground in LA, and come up with these ideas, and then implement them. Like-"
[INPUT]: I have a million ideas.
[Joe Rogan]: I'm sure you do.
[INPUT]: There's no shortage of that. Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: I just don't know how you manage your time. I don't understand it. It doesn't seem -- It doesn't even seem humanly possible.
"[INPUT]: You know, I do, basically -- I think, people, like, don't totally understand what I do with my time. They think, like, I'm a business guy or something like that. Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate."
[Joe Rogan]: What would you call yourself?
[INPUT]: A business magnet. Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet?
[Joe Rogan]: They'll change it for you.
[INPUT]: Please change.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right now, it's probably already changed."
"[INPUT]: It's locked. So, somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet."
[Joe Rogan]: Someone will get that.
"[INPUT]: I want to be a magnet. No, I do engineering, you know, and manufacturing, and that kind of thing. That's like 80% or more of my time."
"[Joe Rogan]: Ideas, and then the implementation of those ideas."
"[INPUT]: Those are like hardcore engineering, like-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: ... designing things, you know."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: It's structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you must understand there's not a whole lot of human beings like you. You know that, right? You're an oddity-"
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: ... to chimps like me.
[INPUT]: We're all chimps.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, we are."
[INPUT]: We're one notch. One notch above a chimp.
"[Joe Rogan]: Some of us are a little more confused. When I watch you doing all these things, I'm like, How does this motherfucker have all this time, and all this energy, and all these ideas, and then people just let him do these things?"
[INPUT]: Because I'm an alien.
[Joe Rogan]: That's what I've speculated.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Then, I'm on record saying this in the past. I wonder."
[INPUT]: It's true.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, if there was one? I was like, If there was, like, maybe an intelligent being that we created, you know, like some AI creature that's superior to people, maybe it's just hanging around with us for a little while like you've been doing, and then fix a bunch of shit. I mean, that's the way."
[INPUT]: I might have some mutation or something like that.
[Joe Rogan]: You might. Do you think you do?
[INPUT]: Probably.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you wonder? Like, around normal people, you're like, Hmm. Think, What's up with these boring dumb motherfuckers? ever?"
"[INPUT]: Not bad for a human, but, I think, I will not be able to hold a candle to AI."
[Joe Rogan]: You scared the shit out of me when you talk about AI between you and Sam Harris.
[INPUT]: Oh sure.
[Joe Rogan]: I didn't consider it until I had a podcast with Sam once.
[INPUT]: That's great.
"[Joe Rogan]: And he made me shit my pants. Talking about AI, I realized, like, Oh, this is a genie that once it's out of the bottle, you're never getting it back in."
[INPUT]: That's true.
[Joe Rogan]: There was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And you're like, In the future, it will be moving so fast, you can't see it without a strobe light."
[INPUT]: Yeah. You can probably do that right now.
"[Joe Rogan]: And no one's really paying attention too much other than people like you, or people that are really obsessed with technology, all these things are happening. And these robots are -- Do you see the one where PETA put out a statement that you shouldn't kick robots?"
[INPUT]: It's probably not wise.
[Joe Rogan]: For retribution.
[INPUT]: Their memory is very good.
[Joe Rogan]: I bet it's really good.
[INPUT]: It's really good.
[Joe Rogan]: I bet it is.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: And getting better every day.
[INPUT]: It's really good.
"[Joe Rogan]: Are you honestly legitimately concerned about this? Are you -- Is, like, AI one of your main worries in regards to the future?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. It's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, you used to have more hope, and you gave up some of it. And, now, you don't worry as much about AI. You're like, This is just what it is."
"[INPUT]: Pretty much. Yes, yes, yes."
[Joe Rogan]: Was that not? Yes but no.
[INPUT]: It's not necessarily bad. It's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control.
"[Joe Rogan]: Not necessarily bad, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. It's not necessarily bad. It's just outside of human control. Now, the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon. It's going to be very tempting. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. So, the on ramp to serious AI, the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other, I think, most likely. That will be the danger. Yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: How far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something's ethically or morally correct, or whether or not it wants to do something, or whether or not it wants to improve itself, or whether or not it wants to protect itself from people or from other AI? How far away are we from something that's really truly sentient?"
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines. That's what a company is. And then, there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed. And then, there's a sort of like a collective AI in the Google, sort of, Search, Google Search, you know, where we're all sort of plugged in as like nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree."
"[INPUT]: And we're all feeding this network with our questions and answers. We're all collectively programming the AI. And Google Plus, all the humans that connect to it, are one giant cybernetic collective. This is also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all the social networks. They're giant cybernetic collectives."
"[Joe Rogan]: Humans and electronics all interfacing, and constantly now, constantly connected."
"[INPUT]: Yes, constantly."
"[Joe Rogan]: One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing. And I wonder how much of that is -- Well, a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation. And it almost seems like it's built into us. It's like what we like and what we want that we're fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time."
"[Joe Rogan]: And it doesn't seem possible that people are going to pump the brakes. It doesn't seem possible at this stage where we're constantly expecting the newest cellphone, the latest Tesla update, the newest MacBook Pro. Everything has to be newer and better. And that's going to lead to some incredible point. And it seems like it's built into us. It almost seems like it's an instinct that we're working towards this, that we like it. Our job, just like the ants build the anthill, our job is to somehow know how fuel this."
"[INPUT]: Yes. I mean, I made this comment some years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI. Effectively, we are building it. And then, we're building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing. And, eventually, we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence. But the AI is informed strangely by the human limbic system. It is, in large part, our id writ large."
[Joe Rogan]: How so?
"[INPUT]: We mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives. There's all of the things that we like, and hate, and fear. They're all there on the internet. They're a projection of our limbic system. That's true."
"[Joe Rogan]: No, it makes sense. And the thinking of it as a -- I mean, thinking of corporations, and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through these social media networks in some sort of an organism that's a -- It's a cyborg. It's a combination. It's a combination of electronics and biology."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. This is -- In some measure, like, it's to the success of these online systems. It's sort of a function of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people. The more limbic resonance, the more engagement."
"[Joe Rogan]: Whereas, like one of the reasons why probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter."
[INPUT]: Limbic resonance.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. You get more images, more video."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: It's tweaking your system more.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you worry or wonder, in fact, of what the next step is? I mean, a lot of you didn't see Twitter coming. You know, communicate with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in. Like it's going to excel. It's going to become more connected to us, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input/output is slow, particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with 10 fingers. Now, we have thumbs. But images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. What sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, what happened with you where you decided, or you took on a more fatalistic attitude? Like, was there any specific thing, or was it just the inevitability of our future?"
"[INPUT]: I try to convince people to slow down. Slow down AI to regulate AI. That's what's futile. I tried for years, and nobody listened."
[Joe Rogan]: This seems like a scene in a movie-
[INPUT]: Nobody listened.
[Joe Rogan]: ... where the the robots are going to fucking takeover. You're freaking me out. Nobody listened?
[INPUT]: Nobody listened.
[Joe Rogan]: No one. Are people more inclined to listen today? It seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years than it was maybe 5-10 years ago. It seemed like science fiction.
"[INPUT]: Maybe they will. So far, they haven't. I think, people don't -- Like, normally, the way that regulations work is very slow. it's very slow indeed. So, usually, it will be something, some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. There will be rule making. Then, there will be oversight, absolutely, of regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things."
"[INPUT]: If you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented, to be required? You know, the auto industry fought seatbelts, I think, for more than a decade. It successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the numbers were extremely obvious. If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on seatbelts. This is a -- This time frame is not relevant to AI. You can't take 10 years from a point of which it's dangerous. It's too late."
"[Joe Rogan]: And you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late. If you have this fatalistic attitude, and you feel like it's going -- We're in an almost like a doomsday countdown."
[INPUT]: It's not necessarily a doomsday countdown. It's a-
[Joe Rogan]: Out of control countdown?
"[INPUT]: Out of control, yeah. People quote the singularity, and that's probably a good way to think about it. It's a singularity. It's hard to predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. So, once it's implemented, it's very difficult because it would be able to-"
"[INPUT]: Once the genie is out of the bottle, what's going to happen?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right. And it will be able to improve itself.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's where it gets spooky, right? The idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation very, very quickly."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And, then, it will be just ridiculous."
[INPUT]: Ridiculous.
"[Joe Rogan]: We will be like this ridiculous biological shitting, pissing thing trying to stop the gods. No, stop. We're like living with a finite lifespan, and watching, you know, Norman Rockwell paintings."
"[INPUT]: It could be terrible, and it could be great. It's not clear."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But one thing is for sure, we will not control it."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology, and it'll augment what we are now, or do you think it will replace us?"
"[INPUT]: Well, that's the scenario. The merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best. Like if-"
[Joe Rogan]: For us?
"[INPUT]: Yes. Like if you can't beat it, join it. That's-"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, yeah."
"[INPUT]: You know. So, from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through fingers. It's too slow."
[Joe Rogan]: And where's Neuralink at right now?
"[INPUT]: I think. we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months. That's, at least, an order of magnitude better than anything else. I think better than, probably, anyone thinks is possible."
[Joe Rogan]: How much can you talk about that right now?
[INPUT]: I don't want to jump the gun on that.
"[Joe Rogan]: But what's like the ultimate? What's the idea behind that? Like, what are you trying to accomplish with it? What would you like best case scenario?"
"[Joe Rogan]: I think, best case scenario, we effectively merge with AI where AI serves as a tertiary cognition layer, where we've got the limbic system. Kind of the, you know, primitive brain essentially. You got the cortex. So, you're currently in a symbiotic relationship. Your cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship. And, generally, people like their cortex, and they like their limbic system. I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both."
"[INPUT]: And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that computing power is. It's launched towards, How can I make the limbic system happy? That's what it's trying to do."
"[INPUT]: Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic. And there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate. Then, that could be a good outcome. That could be quite a positive outcome for the future."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants. This is not a matter of earning power because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So, it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. That's the theory. And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future."
[Joe Rogan]: That billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Radically enhanced?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And which would be -- It -- But how much different than people today? Like if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really understand what you're saying, like how much different are you talking about? When you say radically improved, like, what do you mean? You mean mind reading?"
"[INPUT]: It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? You're vastly smarter actually. You know, you can answer any question. If you connect to the internet, you can answer any question pretty much instantly, any calculation, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly. That's the-"
"[INPUT]: Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. You don't even -- What most people don't realize, they are already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It's just that the data rate, the rate at which -- The communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow."
"[INPUT]: And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw like a giant river. A huge high band with the interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. It's all the data rate problem that I think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term. And then, people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not. I think they'll probably choose to retain the biological self."
[Joe Rogan]: Versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer?
"[INPUT]: You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload it to a new unit literally."
[Joe Rogan]: Pass that whiskey. We're getting crazy over here. This is getting ridiculous.
[INPUT]: Down the rabbit hole.
"[Joe Rogan]: Grab that sucker. Give me some of that. This is too freaky. See, if I was just talking-"
"[INPUT]: I've been thinking about this for a long time, by the way."
"[Joe Rogan]: I believe you. If I was talking to one -- Cheers, by the way."
[INPUT]: Cheers. It is a great whiskey.
[Joe Rogan]: Thank you. I don't know where this came. Who brought this to us?
[INPUT]: I'm trying to remember. I can't-
[Joe Rogan]: Somebody gave it to us. Old Camp. Whoever it was-
[INPUT]: It's good.
[Joe Rogan]: ... thanks.
[INPUT]: It's good.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it is good. This is just inevitable. Again, going back to when you decided to have this fatalistic viewpoint. So, you weren't -- You tried to warn people. You talked about this pretty extensively. I've read several interviews where you talked about this. And then, you just sort of just said, Okay, it just is. Let's just- And, in a way, by communicating the potential for -- I mean, for sure, you're getting the warning out to some people."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was really going on the warning quite a lot. I was warning everyone I could. Yeah, I've met with Obama and just for one reason, like, Better watch out."
[Joe Rogan]: Just talk about AI.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And what did he say? So, what about Hillary? Worry about her first. Shh, everybody, quiet."
[INPUT]: He listened. He certainly listened. I met with Congress. I met with -- I was at a meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just the AI danger. And I talked to everyone I could. No one seemed to realize where this was going.
"[Joe Rogan]: Is it that, or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it? Because when people hear about something like AI, it's almost abstract. It's almost like it's so hard to wrap your head around it."
[INPUT]: It is.
"[Joe Rogan]: By the time it happens, it will be too late?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it. And I said, like, you know, an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight. You know, before you oversight, before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then, once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that would be probably a safer way to go about things."
"[Joe Rogan]: It seems -- I mean, I know that it's probably something that the government's supposed to handle, but it seems like I wouldn't want the -- I don't want the government to handle this."
[INPUT]: Who do you want to handle this?
[Joe Rogan]: I want you to handle this.
[INPUT]: Oh geez.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I feel like you're the one who could bring the bell better because if Mike Pence starts talking about AI, I'm like, Shut up, bitch. You don't know anything about AI. Come on, man. He doesn't know what he's talking about. That's just games."
"[INPUT]: I don't have the power to regulate other companies. I don't if I'm supposed to, but you know."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, but maybe companies could agree. Maybe there could be some sort of a -- What I mean is we have agreements where you're not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean, you're not supposed to do certain things that could be terribly damaging, even though they would be profitable. Maybe this is one of those things."
"[Joe Rogan]: Maybe we should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not, and whether or not it thinks you're a threat, or whether or not it thinks you're useless. Like, Why do I keep this dumb finite life form alive? Why? Why keep this thing around? It's just stupid. It just keeps polluting everything. It's shitting everywhere it goes, lighting everything on fire, and shooting at each other. Why would I keep this stupid thing alive? Because, sometimes, it makes good music, you know. Sometimes it makes great movies. Sometimes it makes beautiful art, and sometimes -- you know. Sometimes it's cool to hang out with. Like with my-"
"[INPUT]: Yes, for all those reasons."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. For us, those are great reasons."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: But for anything objective standing outside that go, This is definitely a flawed system. This is like if you went to the jungle and you watch these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other with wooden sticks."
[INPUT]: Chimps are really mean.
[Joe Rogan]: They're fucking real mean.
[INPUT]: They're fucking mean.
[Joe Rogan]: They're real mean.
"[INPUT]: I saw a movie, Chimpanzee. I thought it was going to be like some Disney thing. Like, holy cow."
[Joe Rogan]: What movie was that?
[INPUT]: It's called Chimpanzee.
[Joe Rogan]: Is it a documentary?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like a documentary. I was like, Damn, these chimps are mean."
[Joe Rogan]: They're mean.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: They're cruel.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. They're calculated. Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: They sneak up on each other and-
"[INPUT]: Like, I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I was pretty -- I left that meeting kinda like, This is dark."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Well, we know better because we've advanced. But if we hadn't, we'd be like, Man, I don't want to fucking live in a house. I like the chimp ways, bro. Chimp ways to go. This is it, man, chimp life. You know, we got-"
[INPUT]: Simple chimp life.
"[Joe Rogan]: Chimp life right now. But we, in a way, to the AI, might be like those chimps and like, These stupid fucks launching missiles out of drones, and shooting each other underwater. Like we're crazy. We got torpedoes, and submarines, and fucking airplanes that drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on cities. We're assholes."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: They might go, Why are they doing this? It might, like, look at our politics, look at what we do in terms of our food system, what kind of food we force down each other's throats. And they might go, These people are crazy. They don't even look after themselves."
"[INPUT]: I don't know. I mean, how much do we think about chimps? Not much."
[Joe Rogan]: Very little.
[INPUT]: It's like-
[Joe Rogan]: It's true.
"[INPUT]: ... these chimps are at war. This like look -- It's like groups of chimps just attack each other, and they kill each other. They torture each other. That's pretty bad. They hunt monkeys. They're -- Like this is probably the most, but, you know. I mean, when was the last time you watched chimps?"
[Joe Rogan]: Me?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: All the time.
[INPUT]: You do.
[Joe Rogan]: You're talking to the wrong guy.
"[INPUT]: Okay. Well, unfortunately, yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: This fucking podcast, dude, we're talking about chimps every episode."
[INPUT]: It's chimp city? Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: People are laughing right now. Yeah, constantly. I'm obsessed."
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: I saw that David Attenborough documentary on chimps where they were eating those colobus monkeys and ripping them apart.
"[INPUT]: Yes, this was rough."
"[Joe Rogan]: I saw that many, many years ago."
[INPUT]: It's gruesome.
[Joe Rogan]: It just changed how-
[INPUT]: Gruesome.
"[Joe Rogan]: I go, Oh, this is why people are so crazy. We came from that thing."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, exactly."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It is the colobus.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: They got, like, better philosophy."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, they're like swingers."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, they really are. They seem to be way more -- Even than us, way more civilized."
[INPUT]: They just seem to resolve everything with sex.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. The only rules they have is the mom won't bang the son. That's it.
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: That's it. Mom won't bang her sons. They're good women.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Good women in the bonobo community. Everybody else is banging it out.
[INPUT]: Yeah. I haven't seen the Bonobo Movie.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, they're disturbing just at a zoo of bonobos at the zoo."
[INPUT]: They're just constantly going.
"[Joe Rogan]: Constantly fucking, yeah. It's all they do."
[INPUT]: It's just one stuff.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And they don't care, gay, straight, whatever. Let's just fuck. What's with these labels?"
[INPUT]: I haven't seen bonobos at a zoo. I just probably like-
[Joe Rogan]: I don't think I have either.
[INPUT]: And not on the PJ section.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I don't think they have them at many zoos. We've looked at it before too, didn't we?"
[INPUT]: It's probably pretty awkward.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I think that's the thing. They don't like to keep regular chimps at zoos because bonobos are just always jacking off and-
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Fucking it.
[INPUT]: In San Diego.
[Joe Rogan]: What's that? They have in San Diego?
"[INPUT]: San Diego's got some, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: Really? Interesting.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Probably separate them. Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I mean, how many are there in a cage, you know? I was like-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: ... It's going to be pretty intense.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're a weird thing, you know. And I've often wondered whether or not we're -- you know, our ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing. And that's why we're so obsessed with technology because it's not like this technology is really -- I mean, it's certainly enhancing our lives too in a certain way, but, I mean, ultimately, is it making people happier right now? Most technology I would say no. In fact, you and I were talking about social media before this about just not having Instagram on your phone, and not dealing, and you feel better."
"[INPUT]: Yes. I think, one of the issues with social media, it's been pointed out by many people, is that, I think, maybe particularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life than they really do."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: So-
[Joe Rogan]: By design.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. People are posting pictures of when they're really happy. They're modifying those pictures to be better looking. Even if they're not modifying the pictures, they're, at least, selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle. So, people basically seem they are way better looking than they basically really are."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And they're way happier seeming than they really are. So, if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, Man, there are all these happy beautiful people, and I'm not that good looking, and I am not happy. So, I must suck, you know. And that's going to make you feel sad; when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually, not that happy. Some of them are really depressed. They're very sad. Some of the happiest-seeming people are actually some of the saddest people in reality. And nobody looks good all the time. It doesn't matter who you are."
[Joe Rogan]: No. It's not even something you should want.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Why do you want to look great all the time?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, exactly. So, I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you're sort of -- People generally think of themselves relative to others. It's like we are constantly re-baselining our expectations. And you can see to say if you watch some show like Naked and Afraid, or, you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while, and you're like, The land that civilization is quite great. People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid."
"[Joe Rogan]: Wasn't there a Theodore quote, that Comparison is the thief of joy."
[INPUT]: Yeah. Happiness is reality minus expectations.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's great too, but the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to people. Is it?"
[INPUT]: Theodore Roosevelt.
"[Joe Rogan]: Roosevelt, fascinating. And when you're thinking about Instagram, because what essentially Instagram is for a lot of people is you're giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent, and they always go towards the glamorous, you know. And when anybody does show, you know, #nofilter, they really do do that. Oh, you're so brave. Look at you, no makeup, you know, which they look good anyway."
"[Joe Rogan]: You look great. What are you doing? Oh my God. You don't have makeup on. You still look hot as fuck. You know what you're doing. I know what you're doing too. They're letting you know. And then, they're feeding off that comment section. Sort of sitting there like it's a fresh stream of love. Like you're getting right up to the sources as it comes out of the earth, and you're sucking that sweet, sweet love water."
"[INPUT]: A lot of emojies, smoggy emojies."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: A lot of emojies.
"[Joe Rogan]: My concern is not so much what Instagram is. It's that I didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers, and comments, and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are."
"[Joe Rogan]: But I worry about where it goes. Like what's the next one? What's the next one? Like, where's is it? Is it going to be augmented to some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real world, you're going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page and some next level thing."
[INPUT]: Yeah. Go live in the simulation.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, man."
[INPUT]: In the simulation.
[Joe Rogan]: Some ready player one type shit that's real. That seems -- we have that HTC vibe here. I've only done it a couple times quite honestly because it kind of freaks me out.
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: My kids fucking love it, man. They love it. They love playing these weirdo games and walking around that headset on. But part of me watching them do it goes, Wow, I wonder if this is like the precursor. Just sort of like if you look at that phone that Gordon Gekko had on the beach and you compare that-"
"[INPUT]: Yes, the big cell phone."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, you pair that to like a Galaxy Note 9."
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like how the fuck did that become that, right? And I wonder when I see this HTC Vibe, I'm like, What is that thing going to be 10 years from now when we're making fun of what it is now? I mean, how ingrained, and how connected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life?"
"[INPUT]: It will be, at some point, indistinguishable from reality."
[Joe Rogan]: We will lose this. We'll lose this. Like you and I are just looking at each other through our eyes.
[INPUT]: Are we?
"[Joe Rogan]: I see you. You see me, I think, I hope."
[INPUT]: You think so?
[Joe Rogan]: I think you probably have regular eyes.
[INPUT]: This could be some simulation.
[Joe Rogan]: It could. Do you entertain that?
"[INPUT]: Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement, 1%, 0.1%, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing. This is nothing. This is nothing."
"[INPUT]: So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end. One of those two things will occur. Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation."
"[Joe Rogan]: Or we're on our way to one, right?"
[INPUT]: Because we exist.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, not just because we exist."
[INPUT]: Pretty exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: We could most certainly be on the road. We could be on the road to that, right. it doesn't mean that it has to have already happened."
[INPUT]: It could be in base reality. It could be in base reality.
"[Joe Rogan]: We could be here now on our way to the road or on our way to the destination where this can never happen again, where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of sharing information. But, right now, we're not there yet. That's possible too, right? It's possible that a simulation is, one day, going to be inevitable, that we're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality, but maybe we're not there yet. That's also possible."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, it is."
[INPUT]: Though we're not quite there yet. This is real. You want to touch that wood?
[INPUT]: It feel very real.
[Joe Rogan]: Maybe that's why everybody is like into like mason jars and shit.
[INPUT]: Mason jars.
"[Joe Rogan]: Suede shoes. People that like craft restaurants, and they want raw wood. Everyone wants the metal people. It seems like people are like longing toward some weird log cabin type nostalgia."
"[INPUT]: Sure, reality."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, like holding on. Like clinging."
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: Dragging their nails through the man like, Don't take me yet."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: I want to-
"[INPUT]: But then, people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle. That's dark."
[Joe Rogan]: It makes me-
[INPUT]: It makes me lose faith in humanity.
"[Joe Rogan]: Mason jar, wine stem and a handle, they have those?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: The sturdy people. That's just assholes. That's like people make pet rocks.
[INPUT]: Rough.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Some people are just assholes. They take advantage of our generous nature.
[INPUT]: It was made with the wine stem. Made with handle.
[Joe Rogan]: They made it that way?
[INPUT]: Yes. They're manufactured like that.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, the one way, they welded it on to the mason jar. You fuck."
[INPUT]: But that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. There would be like-
[INPUT]: But it was made that way.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like trash shit. Oh, this is disgusting. Look at this. It is right there."
"[INPUT]: Yes, it's pretty harsh. Yup."
"[Joe Rogan]: This is terrible. Yeah. That's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard. Like fake breasts from the '60s. It's like if you really long for the ones with ripples, here we go. Yeah. That's almost what that is."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: What are you going to do, man? There's nothing, you know. There's nothing you can do to stop certain terrible ideas from propagating."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Anyway, I don't want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future. There's no point in being pessimistic. It's just too negative because it is-"
[Joe Rogan]: It doesn't help.
"[INPUT]: It doesn't help, you know. I think you want to be -- I mean, my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic. I think, I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: At least, we're on that side."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, yeah."
"[INPUT]: Because if you're pessimistic, it's going to be miserable."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Yeah, nobody wants to be around you anyway if it's the end of the world. You're like, I fucking told you, bro."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, exactly."
[Joe Rogan]: The world is ending. Yeah. It is way -- it is for all.
[INPUT]: I did my part.
[Joe Rogan]: I mean-
[INPUT]: Enjoy the journey.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. If you really want to get morose, I mean, it is what it is for all of us anyway. We're all going to go, unless something changes."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, ultimately, you know, even if we just sort of existed as humans forever, we'd still eventually would be like the heat death of the universe-"
[INPUT]: Gazillion years from now.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, even if we get it past the sun."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: If we figure out a way past the sun running out of juice.
"[INPUT]: Eventually, it's going to end. It's just a question of when."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, it really is all about the journey."
[Joe Rogan]: Or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry about death.
"[INPUT]: The universe, as we know it, will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually."
"[Joe Rogan]: And then, someone's going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it, sell it to French people in another dimension."
[INPUT]: It's just a very long time.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So, I think it's really just about, how can we make it last longer?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Are you a proponent of the multi-universe's theory? Do you believe that there are many, many universes, and that even if this one fades out that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now, and there's an infinite number of them, and they're just constantly in a never-ending cycle of birth and death?"
"[INPUT]: I think most likely. This is just about probability. There are many, many simulations. These simulations, we might as well call them reality, or we could call them the multiverse."
[Joe Rogan]: These simulations you believe are created like someone has manufactured-
[INPUT]: They're running on the substrate.
[Joe Rogan]: So-
[INPUT]: That substrate is probably boring.
[Joe Rogan]: Boring?
[INPUT]: Mmhmm.
[Joe Rogan]: How so?
"[INPUT]: Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's the distillation of what's interesting about life. You know, it takes a year to shoot an action movie. And then, that's all to slow down into two or three hours. So, let me tell you, if you've seen an action movie being filmed, it's freaking -- It's boring. It's super boring. It takes -- There's like lots of takes. Everything's in a green screen. It looks pretty goofy. It doesn't look cool. But once you had the CGI, and have great editing, it's amazing."
"[INPUT]: So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as boring? You'd make simulation way more interesting than base reality."
[Joe Rogan]: That is if this right now is a simulation.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And, ultimately, inevitably, as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor, we're going to create some sort of simulation if we continue on the same technological path we're on right now."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: But we might not be there yet. So, it might not be a simulation here. But it most likely is you feel other places."
[INPUT]: This notion of a place or where is-
[Joe Rogan]: Flawed?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Flawed perception.
"[INPUT]: Like that if you have that, sort of, that vibe you have, which is for the -- that's was made by valve, and it's really valve that made it. HTC did the hardware, but it's really a valve thing."
[Joe Rogan]: Makers of Half-life.
[INPUT]: Yes. Great company.
[Joe Rogan]: Great company.
"[INPUT]: When you're in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? Where are you really?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: You aren't anywhere.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, whereas-"
[INPUT]: You're in the computer.
"[Joe Rogan]: You know, what defines where you are?"
[INPUT]: Exactly.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: It's your perception.
"[Joe Rogan]: Is it your perceptions or is it, you know, a scale that we have under your butt. You're right here. I've measured you. You're the same weight as you were when you left. But meanwhile, your experience is probably different-"
[INPUT]: Why do you think you're where you are right now? You might not be.
[Joe Rogan]: I'll buck up a joint if you keep talking. Your man is just going to come in here. We might have to lock the door.
"[INPUT]: Right now, you think you're in a studio in LA."
[Joe Rogan]: That's what I heard.
[INPUT]: You might be in a computer.
"[Joe Rogan]: Man, I think about this all the time. Yeah, I mean, it's unquestionable that one day that will be the case, as long as we keep going, as long as nothing interrupts us, and if we start from scratch, and, you know, we're single-celled organisms all over again. And then, millions and millions of years later, we become the next thing that is us with creativity and the ability to change this environment. It's going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality. To change -- I mean, almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what what it wants it to be and create new things. And then, those new things will intersect with other people's new things, and there will be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all through technology."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And then, we're going to wonder like, Why are we here? What are we doing?"
[INPUT]: Let's find out.
[Joe Rogan]: Well-
"[INPUT]: I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, right."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right. And then, we evaluate those actions to make sure that it's true."
"[INPUT]: Well, I think there's a movement to that. I mean, in terms of like a social movement. I think some of it's misguided, and some of it's exaggerated, and there's a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there. But it seems like the general trend of, like, social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook, or Twitter, or what have you. And that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible. Looking at this knife? Somebody gave it to me. Sorry."
[INPUT]: Yeah. What is it?
"[Joe Rogan]: Fuck you. My friend, Donnie, brought this with him, and it just stayed here. I have a real samurai sword, if you want to play with that. I know you're into weapons. That's from the 1500s. Samurai's something on the table."
[INPUT]: Good.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: That's cool.
"[Joe Rogan]: I'll grab it. Hold on. Yeah, that's legit samurai sword from an actual samurai from the 1500s. If you pull out that blade, that blade was made the old way where a master craftsman-"
[INPUT]: Folded metal?
"[Joe Rogan]: Folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time, and honed that blade into what it is now. What's crazy is that more than 500 years later, that thing is still pristine. I mean, whoever took care of that and passed it down to the next person who took care of it, and you know until it got to the podcast room, it's pretty fucking crazy."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: One day, someone's going to be looking at a Tesla like that. How many of these fucking backdoor they pop off sideways like a Lamborghini?"
[INPUT]: They should see what the Tesla can do. He didn't -- You should -- I'll show you how to once.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, I've driven one. I love them."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but most people don't know what it can do."
"[Joe Rogan]: In terms like ludicrous mode? In terms of like driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads, is that what you're saying?"
[INPUT]: Any car can do that.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. What can it do that I need to know about?
"[INPUT]: I mean, the Model X can do this like ballet thing to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It's pretty cool."
"[Joe Rogan]: Wait, it dances?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Legitimate, like it goes around?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Why would you program that into a car?
[INPUT]: It seemed like fun.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's what I get about you. That's what's weird. Like when you showed up here, you were all smiles, and you pull out a fucking blowtorch and not a blowtorch, but I'm like, Look at this-"
[INPUT]: Not a flamethrower.
"[Joe Rogan]: Not a flamethrower. Like, He's having fun."
"[INPUT]: I want to be clear, it's definitely not a flamethrower."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you're having fun. Like this thing, you know, you program a car to do a ballet dance, you're having fun."
[INPUT]: It's great.
"[Joe Rogan]: But how do you have the time to do that? I don't understand why you're digging holes under the earth, and sending rockets into space, and powering people in Australia. Like how the fuck do you have time to make the car dance ballet?"
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, You know, what if we make this car dance and play music? I'm like, That sounds great. Please do it. Let's try to get it done in time for Christmas. We did."
[Joe Rogan]: Is there a concern about someone just losing their mind and making it do that on the highway?
"[INPUT]: No, it won't do that."
[Joe Rogan]: What if it's in bumper-to-bumper traffic?
[INPUT]: Nope.
"[Joe Rogan]: No, it won't do it?"
"[INPUT]: No. Actually, you have to sneeze drag."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, sneeze drag."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that's why people don't know about it. But if you have the car-"
[Joe Rogan]: Well-
"[INPUT]: It's like it could do lots of things, lots of things."
"[Joe Rogan]: Once Reddit gets a hold of it, everyone's going to know already."
"[INPUT]: You just have to -- Everyone, if you search for it on the internet, you will find out."
[Joe Rogan]: They will find.
[INPUT]: But people don't know that they should even search for it.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, they do now."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: There's so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3 that people don't know about. We should probably do a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, Do you know the car can do this? and they're like, Nope."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you want to do a video of that? Do you like the fact that some people don't know?
"[INPUT]: No, I think it's probably not. We should tell people."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, probably."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: That would help your product. I mean, it's not like you don't sell enough of them. You sell almost too many of them, right."
"[INPUT]: I mean, I think, a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever. That's what it's meant to be. Well, our goal is to make -- It's not exactly a car. It's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment, make as maximum fun."
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay. Electronic, like big screen, laptop, ridiculous speed, handling, all that stuff."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Do you have a-
[INPUT]: And we're going to put video games in it.
[Joe Rogan]: You are?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Is that wise?
[INPUT]: Well-
[Joe Rogan]: What kind of video games? Candy Crush?
"[INPUT]: You won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game. But, like, for example, we're just putting the Atari emulator, RAM emulator in it. So, we'll play a Missile Command, and Lunar Lander, and a bunch of other things. Yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: That sounds cool.
[INPUT]: It's pretty fun.
[Joe Rogan]: I like that.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, probe the interface for Missile Command because it's too hard with the old trackball. So, there's a touch screen version of Missile Command. So, you have a chance."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you -- You have an old car, don't you? Don't you have like an old Jaguar?"
[INPUT]: Yeah. How did you know that? Let's pause for that. I have a '61 series 1 E-type Jaguar.
[Joe Rogan]: I love cars.
[INPUT]: It's great.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I love old cars."
[INPUT]: The only-
[Joe Rogan]: That's one of the things-
"[INPUT]: Yeah, the only two gassing cars I have are that and an old -- like a Ford Model T that a friend of mine gave me. Those are my only two gasoline cars."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is the Ford Model T all stock? Oh, there's your car. Look at that."
[INPUT]: I have the convertible.
[Joe Rogan]: That is a gorgeous car.
[INPUT]: It's a soft car.
"[Joe Rogan]: God, that's a good looking car."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Is that yours?
"[INPUT]: That is -- It's not mine. It's extremely close to mine, but I don't have a front license plate on mine."
[Joe Rogan]: It's a beautiful car. They nailed it. That new type-
[INPUT]: Mine looks like that.
"[Joe Rogan]: God, they nailed that."
[INPUT]: That's what mine looks like. Maybe it is mine.
[Joe Rogan]: There's certain iconic shapes.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And there's something about those cars too. They're not as capable, not nearly as capable as like a Tesla, but there's something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of like feeling the steering, and the-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... grinding of the gears and the shifting. Something about those that's extremely satisfying even though they're not that competent. Like I have a 1993 Porsche 964. It's like lightweight. It's an RS America. It's not very fast. It's not like in comparison to a Tesla or anything like that. But the thing about it is like it's mechanical, you feel it. Everything's like-"
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's like it gives you this weird thrill, like you're on this clunky ride, and there's all this feedback. There's something to that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah. My E Type is like basically no electronics."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It's-
"[Joe Rogan]: And so, you like that, but you also like electronics."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like Tesla Sup, it's like the far end of electronics."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: It drives itself.
[INPUT]: It's driving itself better every day.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: We're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on, and it'll drive from highway on ramp, to highway exit, do lane changes, overtake other cars-"
[Joe Rogan]: Jesus.
"[INPUT]: To go from one interchange to the next. If you get on, say, the 405, get off 300 miles later, and go through several highway interchanges, and just overtake other cars, and hook into the nav system, and then-."
"[Joe Rogan]: And you're just meditating, om."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: While your car is just traveling.
[INPUT]: It's kind of eerie. It's kind of eerie.
"[Joe Rogan]: What did you think when you saw that video of that dude fallen asleep behind the wheel? I'm sure you've seen it, the one in San Francisco. It's like right outside of San Jose. It's out cold, like this. And the cars an inch bumper-to-bumper in traffic moving along."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: You've seen it, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. We just changed the software. Changed the software. That's, I think, an old video. We changed software. If you don't touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down, and put the emergency lights on, and wake you up."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, that's hilarious."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That's hilarious.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Can you choose what voice wakes you up?
"[INPUT]: Well, it's sort of more of a -- It sort of honks."
[Joe Rogan]: It honks.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: There should be like, Wake up, fuckface. You're endangering your fellow humans."
[INPUT]: We could gently wake you up with a sultry voice.
"[Joe Rogan]: That would be good like something with a southern accent. Hey, wake up."
"[INPUT]: Wake up, sunshine."
"[Joe Rogan]: Hey, sweetie."
[INPUT]: Exactly.
[Joe Rogan]: Why don't you wake up?
[INPUT]: You could pick your-
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, like-"
[INPUT]: Like whatever you want. Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I choose the Australian girl for Siri."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: I like her voice.
[INPUT]: Do you want it seductive?
[Joe Rogan]: It's my favorite. I like Australian.
[INPUT]: What flavor? Do what you want it to be angry. It could be anything.
"[Joe Rogan]: You want those Australian prison lady genes. Now, when you program something like that in, is this in response to a concern, or is it your own?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do look at it and go, Hey, they shouldn't just be able to fall asleep. Let's wake them up."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. It's like -- You know, we're like -- Yeah, people are falling asleep. We've got to do something about that."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. But when you first released it, you didn't consider it, right? You're just like, Well, no one's going to just sleep."
[INPUT]: People fall asleep in their cars all the time.
[Joe Rogan]: All the time.
[INPUT]: They crash.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it's horrible."
"[INPUT]: At least, our car doesn't crash. That's better."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It's better not to crash.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car, they do all the time."
"[Joe Rogan]: For sure, yeah."
[INPUT]: They would crash into somebody.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And, in fact, the thing that really, you know, got me to -- It's like, Man, we better get a autopilot going and get it out. A guy was in an early Tesla driving down the highway, and he fell asleep, and he ran over a cyclist, and killed him. I was like, Man, if we had autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but, at least, he wouldn't run over that cyclist."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, how did you implement it? Like did you just use cameras and-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... programmed with the system, so that if it sees images, it slows down? And how much time do you get? And like-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Is the person who's in control of it allow the program to how fast it goes?
"[INPUT]: Yes. Yeah, you can program it to be more or less, like more conservative or like more aggressive driver. And you can say what speed you want it to -- What speed is okay."
[Joe Rogan]: I know you have ludicrous mode. Do you have douche bag mode?
"[INPUT]: Well, in-"
[Joe Rogan]: It just cuts people off.
"[INPUT]: Well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like LA, like unless you're pretty aggressive, right, it's hard to change lanes sometimes."
[Joe Rogan]: You can't. It's hard to be Satnam. It's hard to be Namaste here in LA.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: If you want to hit that Santa Monica Boulevard off in-
"[INPUT]: I mean, you've got to be a little pushy."
"[Joe Rogan]: You've got to be a little pushy, yeah."
[INPUT]: On the freeway.
[Joe Rogan]: Especially if you were angry.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: If you're a little angry, they don't want you, and they speed up."
"[INPUT]: Sometimes, yeah, I think, people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they're not."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you think the Neuralink will help that quick?
[INPUT]: Probably.
"[Joe Rogan]: Everybody will be locked in together, this hive mind."
[INPUT]: Tunnels will help it. We wouldn't have traffic.
[Joe Rogan]: That will help a lot.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: How many of those can you put in there?
[INPUT]: Nice thing about tunnels-
[Joe Rogan]: Are you thinking about for everybody?
[INPUT]: Nice thing about tunnels is you can go 3D.
[Joe Rogan]: Oh right.
"[INPUT]: So, you can go many levels."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: So-
[Joe Rogan]: Until you hit.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but you go -- You can have 100 levels of with bombs."
[Joe Rogan]: Jesus Christ. I don't want to be on 99. That would be a negative 99 floors.
"[INPUT]: This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that it's not like roads. The fundamental issue with roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment. So, you've got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments. And then, you want to go into those like 2D transport system with-"
[Joe Rogan]: Hugely inefficient.
"[INPUT]: ... pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far. And so, that, obviously, is not going to work. You're going to have traffic guaranteed. But if you can go 3D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic. And you can either go 3D up with a flying car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels. You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels than you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want. I wouldn't recommended it, but-."
"[Joe Rogan]: What was that movie with -- What's his face? Bradley -- Not Bradley Cooper, Christian? No. What the fuck is his name? Batman. Who is Batman?"
[INPUT]: Christian Bale.
"[Joe Rogan]: Christian Bale, where they fought dragons. Him and Matthew McConaughey. He went down deep into the earth. How deep can you go?"
[INPUT]: I don't think that was Batman.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was."
[INPUT]: Batman fought dragons? I don't-
"[Joe Rogan]: No, it wasn't Batman but it's Christian Bale."
[INPUT]: The Rain of Fire.
[Joe Rogan]: Rain of Fire.
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: Never saw that?
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: Terrible. Terrible but good. I would look at it some time.
[INPUT]: I wouldn't recommend drilling super far down but the earth is a big-
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, but you can't drill deep. It gets hot, right?"
[INPUT]: ... molten
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: The earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust. And it's mostly just a big bowl of lava. That's earth, but 10,000 feet is not a big deal."
[Joe Rogan]: Have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat earth movement?
[INPUT]: That's a troll situation.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, it's not. No, it's not. You would like to think that-"
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... because you're super genius. But I, as a normal person, I know these people are way dumber than me. And they really, really believe. They watch YouTube videos, which go on uninterrupted, and spew out a bunch of fucking fake facts very eloquently and articulately. And they really believe. These people really believe."
"[INPUT]: I mean, if it works for them, sure. Fine."
"[Joe Rogan]: It's weird though, right, that in this age where, you know, there's ludicrous mode in your car, goes 1.9 seconds, 060."
[INPUT]: That's 2.2.
[Joe Rogan]: 2.2. Which one's 1.9? The Coaster.
[INPUT]: The Next Generation Roadster.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
[INPUT]: Standard edition.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I'm on top of this shit."
[INPUT]: That's just without-
[Joe Rogan]: Standard edition.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. So, it's not the performance package."
[Joe Rogan]: What performance package?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: What the fuck do you need?
[INPUT]: We put a rocket thruster in it.
[Joe Rogan]: For real?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: What are they going to burn?
[INPUT]: Nothing. Ultrahigh pressure compressed air.
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa. Just air?
[INPUT]: Just called gas thrusters.
"[Joe Rogan]: Then, do you have the air tanks or the-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Sucking air, okay."
[INPUT]: Yeah. It has an electric pump.
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa.
"[INPUT]: Pump it up like 10,000 PSI."
[Joe Rogan]: And how fast are we talking? Zero to 60.
[INPUT]: How fast you want to go?
[Joe Rogan]: I want to go-
[INPUT]: We could make this thing fly.
[Joe Rogan]: I want to go back in time.
[INPUT]: I can make it fly.
[Joe Rogan]: You make it fly?
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you anticipate that as being -- I mean, you're talking about the tunnels and then flying cars. Do you really think that's going to be real?"
"[INPUT]: Too noisy, and there's too much airflow. So, the final issue with flying cars, I mean, if you get like one of those like toy drones, think of how loud those are and how much air they blow. Now, imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. This is not going to make your neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard."
[Joe Rogan]: It will be very helicopter-like.
"[INPUT]: Or on your roof. It's just really going to be like, What the hell. That was annoying."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: You can't even -- Like, if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is there a way around that? Like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those Bob Lazar type characters who were thinking that was a part of the UFO technology they were doing at Area 51? Remember, didn't they have some thoughts about magnetics? Nope."
[Joe Rogan]: No? Bullshit?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. There's a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So, you must accelerate. There's like this -- There's a sudden -- You have a mass, and you have gravitational acceleration. And mass times -- Your mass times gravity must equal the mass of airflow times acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force. MG=MA"
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it's impossible to go around-"
[INPUT]: And then you won't move.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: If MG is greater than MA, you will go down. And if MA is greater than MG, you will go up. That's how it works."
[Joe Rogan]: There's just no way around that?
[INPUT]: There is definitely no way around it.
[Joe Rogan]: There's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to float?
"[INPUT]: Technically, yes. You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble."
[Joe Rogan]: It would just suck cars up into your car? Just pick up axles and do that?
"[INPUT]: I mean, it should have to repel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field, and somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, if there was some sort of magnet road, like you have two magnets, and they repel each other, if you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you, and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. Yes, you can have a magnet road."
[Joe Rogan]: A magnet road. Is that too ridiculous?
"[INPUT]: No, it will work. So, you could do that."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's ridiculous too, right?"
[INPUT]: I would not recommend it.
[Joe Rogan]: There's a lot of things you don't recommend.
"[INPUT]: I would super not recommend that. Not good. Not wise, I think."
[Joe Rogan]: No?
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: Magnet roads?
"[INPUT]: No. No. No, definitely not. Definitely not. Yeah, it would cause a lot of trouble."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, you put some time and consideration into this other than -- You know, instead like my foolishly rendered thoughts. So, you think that tunnels are the way to do it?"
"[INPUT]: Oh, it will work, for sure."
[Joe Rogan]: That'll work?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And these tunnels that you're building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have?"
"[INPUT]: You know, it's just a hole in the ground."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. We played videos of it where your ideas-
[INPUT]: It's just a hole in the ground.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... that you drop that hole in the ground. There's a sled on it, and the sled goes very fast, like 100 miles an hour plus."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it can go real fast. You can go as fast as you want. And then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of the tunnel, make sure it's real straight."
[Joe Rogan]: Draw the air out of the tunnel?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's sort of vacuum tunnel because the -- And then, depending on how fast you want to go, you're going to take these wheels, or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel, or you could mag lev it if you want to go super fast."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, magnet road?"
"[INPUT]: Yes, underground magnet roads."
[Joe Rogan]: Underground magnet roads?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Otherwise, you're going to really create a lot of trouble because of those metal things."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh. So, magnet road is the way to go, just underground."
"[INPUT]: If you want to go really fast underground, you would be mag lev in a vacuum tunnel."
[Joe Rogan]: Mag in a vacuum tunnel.
[INPUT]: Magnetic levitation in a vacuum tunnel launchers. Fun?
[Joe Rogan]: With rocket launchers?
"[INPUT]: No, I would not recommend putting any-"
[Joe Rogan]: Come on.
[INPUT]: ... exhaust gas in the tunnel.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, okay. I see what you're saying because then the air will be gone."
"[INPUT]: Because, then, the air will pump it out."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. You have to pump it out, and you probably have limited amount of air in the first place. Like how much can you breathe? Do you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles, these tubes?"
[INPUT]: No. We have a pressurized pod. It'd be like a little tiny underground spaceship basically.
[Joe Rogan]: Like an airplane because you have air on airplanes. It's not getting new air in.
[INPUT]: It is.
[Joe Rogan]: It is?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: You have like a little hole?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, they have a pump."
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it gets it from the outside?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Wow, I didn't know that."
"[INPUT]: It's like the air's -- Airplanes have it easy because, essentially, you can -- they're pretty leaky, but-"
[Joe Rogan]: Jesus.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, but as long as the air pump is working at a distance. I mean, they have backup pumps, sort of like, you know, three pumps, or four pumps, or something. And then, there's like -- It exhausts through the outflow valve and through whatever seals are not sealing quite right. Usually, the door doesn't seal quite right on the plane. So, there's a bit of leakage around the door. But the pumps exceed the outflow rate. And then, that sets the pressure in the cabin."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, have you ever looked at planes and gone, I can fix this."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: I just don't have the time.
[INPUT]: I have a design for a plane.
[Joe Rogan]: You do?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: A better design?
"[INPUT]: I mean, probably. I think it is, yes."
[Joe Rogan]: Who have you talked to about this?
[INPUT]: I've talked to friends.
[Joe Rogan]: Friends?
[INPUT]: Friends and-
[Joe Rogan]: I'm your friend.
[INPUT]: Girlfriends and-
[Joe Rogan]: You can tell me. What you got? What's going on?
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind."
[Joe Rogan]: Vertical takeoff and landing meaning no need for a runway. Just shoot up straight in the air.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: How would you do that? I mean, they do that in some military aircraft, correct?"
"[INPUT]: Yes. The trick is that you have to transition to level flight. And then, the thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not suitable for high-speed flight."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, you have two different systems? Vertical takeoff is one system?"
[INPUT]: I've thought about this quite a lot. I've thought about this quite a lot.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low. And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy."
"[INPUT]: So, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. So, the force balance -- So, a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you've got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you've got the resistance force of the air."
"[INPUT]: Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance."
[Joe Rogan]: I'm too stupid for this conversation.
[INPUT]: It makes sense though.
"[Joe Rogan]: No, I'm sure it does. Now, when you think about this new idea of of design, when you have this idea about improving planes, are you going to bring this to somebody and check this one out?"
"[INPUT]: Well, I have a lot on my plate."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. That's what I'm saying. I don't know how you do what you do now, but if you keep coming up with these. But it's got to be hard to pawn this off on someone else either, like, Hey, go do a good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want to implement to regular planes.."
"[INPUT]: The airplane, electric airplane isn't necessarily right now. Electric cars are important. We need-"
[Joe Rogan]: We need some sort of-
"[INPUT]: Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic futile. Also, the plane's naturally -- You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this improving over time. So, you know, it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars, it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. It's just crazy. We should not do this. It's very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously, we're going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we're going to -- There's only so much oil we can mine and burn. It's totally logical. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term."
"[INPUT]: So, we know that's the endpoint. We know that. So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? This is an insane experiment. It's the dumbest experiment in human history. Why are we doing this? It's crazy."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines, a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world, not that big of a deal? And then, slowly but surely over a century, it got out of control. And now, it's not just our fuel, but it's also, I mean, fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics, so many different items that people buy. It's just this constant desire for fossil fuels, constant need for oil-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Without consideration of the sustainability.
"[INPUT]: You know, the things like oil, oil, coal, gas, it's easy money."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: It's easy money. So-
"[Joe Rogan]: Have you heard about clean coal? The president's been tweeting about it. It's got to be real. CLEAN COAL, all caps. Did you see? He used all caps. Clean coal."
"[INPUT]: Well, you know, it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground. It doesn't like being in solid form."
[Joe Rogan]: Have you thought about something like that?
[INPUT]: It takes a lot of energy.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like some sort of a filter, giant building-sized filter sucks carbon out in the atmosphere? Is that possible?"
"[INPUT]: No, no, it doesn't. It's not possible."
[Joe Rogan]: No?
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: No?
"[INPUT]: Nope, definitely not."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, we're fucked?"
"[INPUT]: No, we're not fucked. I mean, this is quite a complex question."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You know, we're really just -- When we -- The more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right -- I think we're okay right now. We can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow."
"[INPUT]: Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year. So, it would take -- If you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. It makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? About 20 to 25 years."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially?"
"[INPUT]: Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say, okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere."
"[INPUT]: And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it's not clear what that number is. But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite -- The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming."
"[INPUT]: I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up -- you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there's just -- you know, with rockets, there's just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way."
"[INPUT]: But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day."
"[INPUT]: And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air to the north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans."
"[INPUT]: So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now."
"[Joe Rogan]: And what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars, and trucks, and things like that? Is it battery capacity?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. You got to scale up production. You got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars."
"[Joe Rogan]: Make it more efficient in terms of, like, the distance it can travel? You're going to be fueling-"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, you're going to be able to go far enough, recharge fast."
"[Joe Rogan]: And your Roadster, you're anticipating 600 miles. Is that correct?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: What is it? What is that?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, 600 miles."
[Joe Rogan]: Is that right now? Like have you driven one 600 miles now?
"[INPUT]: No. We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive. So, like the car's got to-"
[Joe Rogan]: How much more so?
"[INPUT]: Well, you know, just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles as long as you're-"
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, versus what do you have now?"
[INPUT]: 330-mile range. That's plenty for most people.
[Joe Rogan]: 330-mile range. And what is that mean in terms of kilowatts?
"[INPUT]: Well, that would be for Model S, 100-kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles. Maybe 335 because some people have hyper mild it to 500 miles per mile."
[Joe Rogan]: Hyper mild it. What does that mean?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, just like go on-"
[Joe Rogan]: 45 miles an hour or something?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, like 30 miles an hour or so. It's like on level ground with -- You pump the tires up really well, and go on a smooth surface, and you can go for a long time. But, you know, like definitely comfortably do 300 miles."
[Joe Rogan]: Is there any-
"[INPUT]: This is fine for most people. Usually, 200 or 250 miles is fine. 300 miles is -- You don't even think about it really."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is there any possibility that you could use solar power, solar-powered one day, especially in Los Angeles? I mean, as you said about that giant nuclear reactor, a million times bigger than Earth just floating in the sky. Is it possible that one day, you'll be able to just power all these cars just on solar power? I mean, we don't ever have cloudy days if we do just three of them."
"[INPUT]: Well, the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some-"
[Joe Rogan]: Like a G wagon.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, and just like if it looked a lot of surface area, or like maybe like solar panels fold out, or something-"
[Joe Rogan]: Like your E class. That's what it needed.
[INPUT]: That E type?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, the Jaguar E type with a giant long hood, that could be a giant solar panel."
"[INPUT]: Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing. They'd press a button, and it would just like unfold these solar panels, and like charge/recharge your car in the parking lot. Yeah, we could do that, but I think it's probably better to just put that on your roof."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, yeah."
"[INPUT]: And then, it's going to -- It should be facing the sun all the time because like-"
[Joe Rogan]: What car have that on the roof?
"[INPUT]: Otherwise, your car could be in the shade. You know, it could be in the shade, it could be in a garage, or something like that."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Didn't the Fisker have that on the roof? The Fisker Karma New Generation for -- I believe, it was only for the radio. Is that correct?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I mean, but I think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something."
[Joe Rogan]: Did you laugh when they started blowing up when they get hit with water? Do you remember what happened?
[INPUT]: They got what?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, they had a dealership or-"
[INPUT]: Oh yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: The Fisker Karmas were parked-
[INPUT]: Is that like that with a flood in Jersey?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, yes."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: When the hurricane came in, they got overwhelmed with water, and they all started exploding. There's a fucking great video of it. Did you watch the video?"
"[INPUT]: I didn't watch the video, but I did see -- It's like some picture of the aftermath."
"[Joe Rogan]: If I was you, I'd be naked, lubed up, watch that video, laugh my ass off. They all blow up. They got wet, and they blew up. That's not good."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, we made our battery waterproof, so that doesn't happen. Actually-"
[Joe Rogan]: Smart move.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, there was a guy in Kazakhstan that -- I think it was Kazakhstan that he just boated through a tunnel, an underwater tunnel, like a flooded tunnel, and just turned the wheels to steer, and pressed the accelerator, and it just floated through the tunnel."
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
"[INPUT]: And he steered around the other cars. I mean, like-"
[Joe Rogan]: That's amazing.
[INPUT]: It's on the internet.
"[Joe Rogan]: What happens if your car gets a little sideways, like if you're driving in snow? Like what if you're driving, if you're autopilot is on, and you're in like Denver, and it snows out, and your car gets a little sideways, does it correct itself? Does that-"
[INPUT]: Oh yeah. It's got great traction control.
"[Joe Rogan]: But does it know how to like correct? You know how, like, when your Ascend-"
"[INPUT]: Oh yeah, sure."
"[Joe Rogan]: ... kicks, you know how to counter steer?"
"[INPUT]: Oh, yeah. No, it's really good."
[Joe Rogan]: It knows how to do it?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa.
[INPUT]: It's pretty crazy.
[Joe Rogan]: That's pretty crazy.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, like if you're going sideways, it knows how to correct itself?"
[INPUT]: It generally won't go sideways.
[Joe Rogan]: It won't?
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: Why not?
[INPUT]: It will correct itself before it goes sideways.
[Joe Rogan]: Even in black eyes?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. There's videos where you could see the car, the traction-"
[Joe Rogan]: Not alone.
[INPUT]: Traction control system is very good. It makes you feel like Superman. It's great. You like feel like you can -- Like it's -- It will make you feel like this incredible driver.
[Joe Rogan]: I believe it.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, how do you program that?"
[INPUT]: We do have testing on like an ice lake in Sweden.
[Joe Rogan]: Oh really?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And like Norway, and Canada, and a few other places."
[Joe Rogan]: Porsche does a lot of that too? They do-
[INPUT]: They did it as well?
"[Joe Rogan]: They do a lot of their -- They do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces. So, you're just -- The car is going sideways whether you like it or not. And you have to learn how to slide into corners, and how do we test."
[INPUT]: Yeah. Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Sort of like where you're gassing a car, you've got a lot of latency. It takes a while for the engine to react, but for electric motors, incredibly precise. That's why you're like -- You imagine like if you had like a printer or something, you wouldn't have a gasoline engine printer. That would be pretty weird or like a surgical device. It's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the printer. Gasoline engine's going to be just chugging away. It's not going to have the reaction time."
"[INPUT]: But to an electric motor, it's operating at the most second level. So, it can turn on and off traction within, like, inches of getting on the onus. Like, let's say, you're driving on a patch of ice, it will turn traction off, and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like a little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly. You're like a -- You're a snail. You're just moving so slowly because it can see at a thousand frames a second. And so, it's like, say, one Mississippi. It just thought about it things a thousand times."
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it's to realize that your wheels are not getting traction. It understands there's some slippery surface that you're driving on."
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: And it makes adjustments in real time.
"[INPUT]: Yes, in milliseconds."
[Joe Rogan]: That would be so much safer than a regular car.
"[INPUT]: Yes, it is."
"[Joe Rogan]: Just that alone, for loved ones, you'd want them to be driving your car."
[INPUT]: Yes. The-
"[Joe Rogan]: Or on board. Fuck motors. Dude, fuck regular motors."
"[INPUT]: That S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government."
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa.
"[INPUT]: So, this -- Yeah, but it's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. Like we -- You know, people still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60 miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle, and they slipped. Like they will be dead in another car, they still sue us."
"[Joe Rogan]: But that's to be expected, isn't it?"
[INPUT]: It is to be expected.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic, you know, undertones to sort of just go, You've got to just let it go. This is what people do."
[INPUT]: I tell you I've got-
[Joe Rogan]: This is what it is.
"[INPUT]: ... Quite a lot of respect for the justice system. Judges are very smart. And they see -- they've -- as like I haven't. So far, I've found judges to be very good at justice because like what -- and juries are good too. Like, they're actually quite good. You know, people -- You know, you read about like occasional errors in the justice system. Let me tell you, most the time, they're very good."
"[INPUT]: And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist. And that was what encouraged me to get autopilot out as soon as possible. That guy sued us."
[Joe Rogan]: He sued you for falling asleep?
[INPUT]: Yes. I'm not kidding. He blamed it on the new car smell.
[Joe Rogan]: What?
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: He blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell. Does someone that's a lawyer-
[INPUT]: This is a real thing that happened.
[Joe Rogan]: Someone that's a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up.
"[INPUT]: Yes, he got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, This is crazy. Stop bothering me. No."
[Joe Rogan]: Thank God.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Thank God. Thank God there's a judge out there with a brain.
"[INPUT]: I tell you, judges are very good."
[Joe Rogan]: Some of them.
[INPUT]: I have a lot of-
[Joe Rogan]: What about that judge that sent all these boys up the river in Pennsylvania who was selling those kids out? You know about that story?
[INPUT]: Nope.
[Joe Rogan]: Judge was selling young boys to prisons. He was like literally-
[INPUT]: What?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, literally, under bribes for -- He was-"
[INPUT]: Was this an elected judge or-
[Joe Rogan]: He was-
[INPUT]: Because sometimes you have a judge that's like actually a politician.
"[Joe Rogan]: No, he was a elected judge. This is a very famous story."
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: He's in jail right now, I think, for the rest of his life. And he put away -- He would take like a young boy who would do something like steal something from a store, and he would put them in detention for, you know, five years. Something ridiculous egregious. And they investigated his history. And they found out that he was literally being paid off. Was it by private prisons? Is that what the the deal was? There was some sort of -- But, anyway, this judge is-"
"[INPUT]: Actually, two judges."
[Joe Rogan]: Two judges?
"[INPUT]: Two judges. Kids for cash scandals, let's call them."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: 2008, yeah. Common pleas judges. So, I think they are elected."
[Joe Rogan]: And who was paying them? Someone -- It proven to the point where they're in jail now that someone was paying them to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons.
[INPUT]: It's like a million-dollar payment to put them in a youth center builder.
[Joe Rogan]: A million-dollar payment?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: I do think these private prisons thing is-
[Joe Rogan]: Someone business.
[INPUT]: ... creating a bad incentive.
[Joe Rogan]: It's dark.
"[INPUT]: Right, yes. But, I mean, that judge is in prison."
[Joe Rogan]: Thank God.
"[INPUT]: Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you-"
[Joe Rogan]: No.
[INPUT]: ... this is not the case. The vast majority of judges are very good.
[Joe Rogan]: I agree.
"[INPUT]: And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer. And instead, they cared about justice, and they made less money because they care about justice. And that's why they're judges."
[Joe Rogan]: I feel that same way about police officers.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: I feel like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific, we tend to look at that like, This is evidence that police are all corrupt. And I think that's crazy."
[INPUT]: No. Most police are very honest.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: And like the military-
[Joe Rogan]: Like they have an insanely-
[INPUT]: ... personnel that I know-
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: ... are very honorable, ethical people."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: And much more honorable and ethical than the average person. That's my impression.
[Joe Rogan]: I agree. That's my impression as well.
"[INPUT]: And that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical. And, obviously, if somebody is given a trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such situations-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: ... and take action. But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession.
"[Joe Rogan]: I couldn't agree more. I think there's also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officers, prosecutors, and anyone that's trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game. And in games, people want to win."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And sometimes, people cheat."
"[INPUT]: Yes, yes. I mean, you know, if you're a prosecutor, you should not always want to win. There are times when you should like, Okay. I just should not want to win this case. And then, you know, like just pass on that case. Sometimes, people want to win too much. That is true."
"[INPUT]: I think, also, it becomes tough. If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals. And then, your view of the world can get negatively."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: You know, have a negative -- You know, you can have a negative view of the world because, you know, you're just interacting with a lot of criminals. But, actually, most of society is not to consist of criminals."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And I, actually, had this conversation at dinner several years ago with, I guess, it's Tony. I was like, Man, it must, sometimes, seem pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some terrible human beings out there. And he was like, Yup. And he was like dealing with some case, which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money. It was rough. Like, Wow, that's pretty rough. It's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, you know, it's only a few percent of society that are actually bad."
"[INPUT]: And then if you go to the worst, say 0.1% of society are the worst, one in a thousand, one in a million, you know. Like how bad is the millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad. Like damn evil."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah,"
"[INPUT]: Like the millionth, well, one in a million of evil is so evil, people cannot even conceive of it. But there's 330 million people in the United States. So, that's 330 people out there somewhere. But by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: On the other side.
"[Joe Rogan]: But because of our fear of danger, we tend to -- our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worst-case scenario."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: And we want to frame that. And that's one of the real problems with prejudice, whether it's prejudice towards different minorities, or prejudice towards police officers, or anything, it's like we want to look at the worst-case scenario and say, This is an example of what this is all about.."
"[Joe Rogan]: And you see that even with people, how they frame genders. Some men frame women like that. They get ripped off by a few women, and they said, All women are evil. Some women get fucked over by a few men, All men are shit. And this is very toxic."
[INPUT]: It is.
"[Joe Rogan]: And it's also -- It's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world, and it's very emotionally-based, and it's based on your own experience, your own anecdotal experience. And it can be very influential to the people around you, and it's just it's a dangerous way. It's a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote."
"[INPUT]: It is. It is a very dangerous, but I really think, you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are good until proven otherwise. And, I think, really, most people are actually pretty good people. Nobody's perfect."
[Joe Rogan]: They have to be.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: If you think of vast numbers of us that are just interacting with each other constantly-
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: ... we have to be better than we think we are.
"[INPUT]: Yes. I mean, like-"
[Joe Rogan]: There's no other way.
"[INPUT]: I mean, here are these weapons but how many times, like, nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're-"
[Joe Rogan]: Nobody yet.
"[INPUT]: Yes, nobody. It's like the sword right there."
"[Joe Rogan]: Not the flamethrower, fake flamethrower here-"
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's not a flamethrower. Now, we've got a real problem, I'm going to put it on that side to him and leave it for the guests."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I'm like, Look, man, if I say something that fucked up, it's right there."
[INPUT]: It will liven things up for sure. It's guaranteed to make any party better.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Well, that's -- I mean, that's the armed civilization theory, right. An armed community is safe and polite community."
"[INPUT]: You know, in Texas, it's kind of true. Yeah. I mean-"
"[Joe Rogan]: People in Texas are super polite. Therefore, they've got a gun."
[INPUT]: Yes. Don't make somebody angry.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: We don't know what's going to happen.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it's a good move."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Piss people off, and everybody are going to have a gun."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: You're off to just let that guy get in your lane.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. You know, we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco."
[Joe Rogan]: Oh yeah? Beautiful.
"[INPUT]: Yes, Space X in McGregor. It's about 15 minutes away from Waco."
[Joe Rogan]: That's close to where Ted Nugent lives.
[INPUT]: It is?
[Joe Rogan]: Shout out to Ted Nugent.
"[INPUT]: Okay, cool."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, there's -- You know, we have lots of fire, and loud explosions, and things, and people-"
[Joe Rogan]: I bet.
[INPUT]: ... they are cool with it.
[Joe Rogan]: They don't give a fuck out there.
[INPUT]: They're very supportive.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. You can buy fireworks where, you know, your kids go to school."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. You know, it's dangerous."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, but it's free."
[INPUT]: It's free.
[Joe Rogan]: There's something about Texas-
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... that's very enticing because of that. It is dangerous, but it's also free."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah. I kind of like Texas actually.
"[Joe Rogan]: I prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal. Like just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of, you know, right wing type characters, it doesn't mean you have to be that way, you know."
[INPUT]: No.
"[Joe Rogan]: And, honestly, there's a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open minded and let you do whatever you want to do."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: As long as you don't bother them.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, exactly."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's my hope right now with the way we're able to communicate with each other today and how radically different it is than generations past because we all -- Just, the dust settles. We all realize, like what you're saying that most people are good."
[INPUT]: Most people are good.
[Joe Rogan]: The vast majority?
"[INPUT]: Yes. I think if you give people the benefit of doubt, for sure."
[Joe Rogan]: I think you're right. You know who could help with that? Mushrooms.
[INPUT]: Mushrooms.
[Joe Rogan]: Don't you think?
[INPUT]: They're delicious.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, right."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: They're good for you too.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: All of them. All kinds of them. What do you see in terms of, like, when you think about the future of your companies, what do you see is like bottlenecks? Want some more of this?"
[INPUT]: Sure. Thank you.
[Joe Rogan]: What do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are holding back innovation? Is it regulatory commissions and people that don't understand the technology that are influencing policy? Like what could potentially be holding you guys back right now? Is there anything that you would change?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I wish politicians were better at science. That would help a lot."
[Joe Rogan]: That's a problem.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: There's no incentive for them to be good at science.
"[INPUT]: There isn't. Actually, you know, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy mayor has a physics degree. I met them, And Mayor says, Shanghai is really smart and-."
"[Joe Rogan]: You're up on technology. What do you think about this government policy of stopping use of Huawei phones? And there's something about the the worry about spying. I mean, from what I understand from real tech people, they think it's horseshit."
[INPUT]: Oh I-.
[Joe Rogan]: Like phones.
[INPUT]: I don't know. I don't know.
"[Joe Rogan]: Like the government say, Don't you buy Huawei phones. Are you up on that at all? No? Should we just abandon this idea?"
"[INPUT]: Well, I think, like, I guess, if you have like top secret stuff, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use. But, you know, like most people do not have top secret stuff."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And, like, nobody really cares what porn you watch like, you know."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, yeah."
"[INPUT]: It's like nobody actually cares, you know. So-."
"[Joe Rogan]: If they do, that's kind of them."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It's just like-
"[INPUT]: National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass which porn you watch. They do not care. So, like, what secrets does a national spy agency have to learn from the average citizen? Nothing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, that's the argument against the narrative. And the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these companies, like Huawei, are innovating at a radical pace, and they're trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting this. Like right now, they're the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world."
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: Samsung is number one. Huawei is number two. Apple is now number three. They surpassed Apple as number two. And the idea is that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in America. There's no carriers that have their phones. You have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party, and then put-"
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: And the worry is, you know, that these are somehow another controlled by the Chinese government. The Communist Chinese government is going to distribute these phones. And I don't know if the worry's economic influence or they'll have too much power. I don't know what it is. Are you paying attention on any of this?"
[INPUT]: Not really.
[Joe Rogan]: No?
"[INPUT]: I don't think we should worry too much about Huawei phones, you know. Maybe, you know, a national security agency shouldn't have Huawei phones. Maybe that's a question mark. But I think for the average citizen, this doesn't matter. Just like no, they're not. I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings of the average American citizen."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is there a time where you think that there will be no security, it will be impossible to hold back information that whatever bottleneck we'll let go, we're going to give in? That whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that we're just going to abandon it, and there'll be no security, no privacy?"
[INPUT]: Do people want privacy? Because they seem to put everything on the internet. Practically-.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, right now, they are confused, but when you're talking about your Neuralink, and this this idea that one day, we're going to be able to share information, and we're going to be some sort of a thing that's symbiotically connected?"
[INPUT]: Yeah. I think we really worry about security in that situation
[Joe Rogan]: And when-
[INPUT]: For sure. That's like security will be paramount.
[Joe Rogan]: Sure.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: But, also, what we will be. This will be so much different. Our concerns about money, about status, about where all of these things will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened, if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an AI interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information? But, you know, what happens then? What is important? What is not important? Is privacy important when we're all gods?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: ... we probably will not think going forward.
"[Joe Rogan]: Shame, right? Information, right? What are hiding? Emotions? What are we hiding?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, I think, like, I don't know. Maybe it's like embarrassing stuff."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, embarrassing stuff."
"[INPUT]: But there's actually -- Like, I think, people, there's like not that much that's kept private that people -- that is actually relevant."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: That other people would actually care about. When you think other people care about it, but they don't really care about it. And, certainly, governments don't."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, some people care about it. But, then, it gets weird when it gets exposed. Like Jennifer Lawrence, when those naked pictures got exposed, like, I think, in some ways, people liked her more."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: They realized like she's just a person. It's just a girl who likes sex, and is just alive, and has a boyfriend, and sends him messages. And, now, you get to look into it, and you probably shouldn't have, but somebody let it go, and they put it online, and all right."
[INPUT]: She seems to be doing okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: She's a person. She's just you, and me, and it's the same thing. She's just in some weird place where she's on a 35-foot tall screen with music playing every time she talks."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, I'm sure like not-"
"[Joe Rogan]: No, but she's fine."
"[INPUT]: She's not happy about it, but she's-"
[Joe Rogan]: No.
[INPUT]: But she's clearly doing fine.
"[Joe Rogan]: But once this interface is fully realized where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability, our ability to understand irrational thoughts, and mitigate them, and that we're all connected in some sort of an insane way. I mean, what are our thoughts on wealth, our thoughts on social status? Like how many of those just evaporate? And our need for privacy, maybe our need for privacy will be the ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to surpass."
"[INPUT]: I think, the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but there will be things that are important. It's just, like, different things."
[Joe Rogan]: What will be more important?
[INPUT]: I don't know. There might be some more of ideas potentially. I don't think Darwin's going away.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Darwin's going to be there.
"[Joe Rogan]: That was that, yeah."
[INPUT]: Darwin will be there forever.
"[Joe Rogan]: Forever, yeah."
[INPUT]: It would just be a different arena. Different arena.
[Joe Rogan]: A digital arena.
[INPUT]: Different arena. Darwin is not going away.
[Joe Rogan]: What keeps you up at night?
"[INPUT]: Well, it's quite hard to run companies."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Especially car companies, I would say. It's quite challenging."
[Joe Rogan]: The car business is the hardest one of all the things you do?
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, because it's a consumer-oriented business as opposed to like SpaceX and-"
"[INPUT]: Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive. It's very difficult. You know, there's only two companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford and Tesla. That's it."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, Ford rode out that crazy storm, huh? They're the only one."
[INPUT]: By the skin of their teeth.
[Joe Rogan]: Shot out to the Mustang.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, by the skin of their teeth. That is interesting, right?"
"[INPUT]: Same with Tesla, we barely survived."
[Joe Rogan]: How close did you get to folding?
"[INPUT]: Very close. I mean, 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car company. That was like stupidity squared."
[Joe Rogan]: And this is when you had those cool Roadsters with the T-top?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: With a target top?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. We had like a -- It was highly modified Elise chassis. The body was completely different. By the way, that was a super dumb strategy that we actually did because we-"
[Joe Rogan]: What's dumb?
"[INPUT]: It was based on two false premises. One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise, and use that as a car platform, and that we'll be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train on the battery. Premise, the AC propulsion technology did not work in production, and we ended up using none of it in long-term. None of it. We had to resign everything."
"[INPUT]: And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car, it got heavier. It got 30% heavier. It invalidated the entire structure, all the crash structure. Everything had to be redone. Nothing. Like, I think, it had less than 7% of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything."
[Joe Rogan]: 7%?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Everything? Including tires, and wheels, bolts, brakes?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, even every-"
[Joe Rogan]: Steering wheel? Seat?
"[INPUT]: The steering wheel was -- I think, the steering wheel was almost the same. Yes, the windscreen. The windscreen."
[Joe Rogan]: Different?
"[INPUT]: No. I think, the windscreen is the same."
[Joe Rogan]: Same?
"[INPUT]: Yes. I think, we were able to keep the windscreen."
"[Joe Rogan]: But the last was 7%. So, that's basically-"
"[INPUT]: Every body panel is different. The entire structure was different. We couldn't use the, like, the HVAC system, the air conditioner. It was belt-driven air conditioner. So, now, we needed something that was electrically driven. We need a new AC compressor."
"[Joe Rogan]: And all that takes away from the battery life as well, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt-driven. It was very difficult."
"[Joe Rogan]: How much of those weigh, those cars, the Roadster?"
[INPUT]: I think it was 2700 pounds.
[Joe Rogan]: That's still very light.
"[INPUT]: 27. Depending on which version, 2650 to 2750 pounds, something like that."
[Joe Rogan]: And what was the weight distribution?
"[INPUT]: It was about 50 -- Well, there were different versions of the car. So, it's about 55 on the rear."
[Joe Rogan]: That's not bad.
[INPUT]: It was rear bias.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, but not bad. Considering like a 911, which is like one of the most popular sports cars of all time. Heavy rear end bias."
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, yeah. The 911, I'm not going to joke, is like the master despite Newton not being on their side."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I guess, fighting Newton, it's very difficult."
[Joe Rogan]: Well-
[INPUT]: It's like you've got those -- The moments of inertia on a 911 don't make any sense.
[Joe Rogan]: They do once you understand them. Once you understand-
[INPUT]: You don't want to hang the engine off the ass. This is not a wise move.
[Joe Rogan]: You don't want to let up on the gas when you're in a corner.
"[INPUT]: The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed. You cannot solve this. It's unsolvable. You're screwed. Polar moment of inertia, you're screwed."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top, that's your polar moment of inertia. You're just -- I promise I wouldn't swear on this show, by the way."
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Says who?
[INPUT]: This was for a friend.
[Joe Rogan]: Tell that friend to go fuck himself. Who told you not to swear?
[INPUT]: A friend.
[Joe Rogan]: He's not a good friend.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That friend need to-
[INPUT]: I said I wouldn't swear.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... realize you're fucking Elon Musk. You can do whatever you want, man. If you ever get confused, call me."
[INPUT]: I'll swear in private. Swear up a storm.
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay, just say freaking. It's a fun way. It's like old house moms. Wives and shit that have children, Oh, this freaking thing."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. But, anyway, like the Portia, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics-."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: The moments of inertia are so messed up. To actually still make it work well is incredible.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, if you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it, there's actual benefits to it. You know, there are some benefits."
"[INPUT]: I enjoy. The car I had before, Tesla was a 911."
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
[INPUT]: That was-
[Joe Rogan]: 997 or 6?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: 997?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Great car, man."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, particularly, the Porsche wouldn't have the variable veins on the turbo, and it didn't have the turbo lag. That was great."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: That was really great. The turbo lag is, like, you know, if you flirt, like phone home, call your mom."
"[Joe Rogan]: The older one, right?"
[INPUT]: It's like about an hour later-
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: ... the car accelerates.
[Joe Rogan]: And super dangerous too because where it will start spinning and-
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. There's something fun about it though like feeling that rear weight kicking around, you know. And again-"
"[INPUT]: No, it's great."
[Joe Rogan]: ... it's not efficient.
[INPUT]: It had a good feel to it.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I agree."
"[Joe Rogan]: But that's what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have, the '93 911. It's not fast. It's not the best handling car, but it's more satisfying than any other car I have because it's so mechanical. It's like everything about it, like crack holes, and bumps, and it gives you all this feedback. And I take it to the comic store because when I get there, I feel like my brain is just popping, and it's on fire. It's like a strategy for me now that I really stop driving other cars there. I drive that car there just for the brain juice, just for the-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: The interaction.
"[INPUT]: I mean, you should try Model S P100D."
[Joe Rogan]: I'll try it.
[INPUT]: It will blow your mind-
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
[INPUT]: ... and your skull.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Tell me what to order, I'll order it."
[INPUT]: Model S P100D.
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay. Jamie, write it down."
[INPUT]: That's the car that I drive.
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay. Okay, I'll get the car you drive. Okay."
[INPUT]: It will blow your mind-
[Joe Rogan]: How far can I drive?
[INPUT]: ... out of your skull.
[Joe Rogan]: I believe you.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: How far can I drive? How far can I drive?
[INPUT]: About 300 miles.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's good. For LA regular days, that's good."
[INPUT]: You will never notice the battery.
[Joe Rogan]: Never?
[INPUT]: Never.
[Joe Rogan]: How hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house? That difficult?
"[INPUT]: No, it's super easy. It's like, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you-
[INPUT]: It's like a dryer plug. It's like a dryer outlet.
[Joe Rogan]: Didn't you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. I have it on my roof right now actually. I'm just trying it out. The thing is it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, like, you want your roof to last like 30 years."
[Joe Rogan]: Could you put it over a regular roof?
"[INPUT]: No. So, there's two versions. It's like the solar panels you put on a roof. So, like, it depends on whether your roofs new or old. So, if your roofs new, you don't want to replace the roof. You want to put like solar panels on the roof."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, that's like retrofit, you know. And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice. But then, the new product were coming out with it is if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles."
"[INPUT]: And then, it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile. So, you have to really work with the glass, and the various coatings, and the layers, so that you don't see the solar cells behind the glass. Otherwise, it doesn't look right."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, it's really tricky."
"[Joe Rogan]: There it is. Jaime, put it up there."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Man, that looks good. Is there a-"
"[INPUT]: See, like, if you look closely, you can see. If you zoom in, like, you can see the cell. But if you zoom out, you don't see the cell."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, but it looks though."
[INPUT]: See?
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Like that's hard.
[Joe Rogan]: That's invisible solar cells.
[INPUT]: It's really hard because you have to get the sunlight go through.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But when it gets reflected back out, it doesn't -- it hides the fact that there's a cell there."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, are those available to the consumer right now?"
"[INPUT]: Well, we have -- I think, that's-"
[Joe Rogan]: Those on that roof right there?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's amazing. Oh, that looks good."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Ooh, I like that."
[INPUT]: That one is hard.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh. So, you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing. I like that."
[INPUT]: That's French slate.
[Joe Rogan]: That's why people in Connecticut are smoking pipes. Look at that one.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: That's badass, dude. So, now-"
[INPUT]: This will actually work.
"[Joe Rogan]: I believe you. So, the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at, is that sufficient to power the entire home?"
[INPUT]: It depends on your energy on how efficient-
[Joe Rogan]: Expenditure?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So, generally, yes. I would say it's probably for most. It's going to vary, but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half. Like call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space."
[Joe Rogan]: And how ridiculous you are with your TV.
[INPUT]: TVs no problem. Air conditioning.
[Joe Rogan]: Air conditioning.
"[INPUT]: Air conditioning is the problem. If you have an efficient air conditioner, and you don't -- and depending on how -- like, are you air conditioning rooms when they don't need to be air conditioned, which is very common-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: ... because it's a pain in the neck, you know. It's like programming a VCR. It's like-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Now, it's just blinking 12[Joe Rogan]: Right. You know how a smart home where if you're in the room, then it stays cool, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home, and then cool the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence. We're not talking about like genius home here. We're talking like elementary basic stuff."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You know, like if you could hook that into the car, like manage you coming home. Like there's no point cooling the home-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: ... keeping the home really cool when you're not there.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But it can tell that you're coming home, it's just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you have an app that works with your solar panels or anything like that?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Yeah, we do."
[Joe Rogan]: And-.
[INPUT]: But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work.
[Joe Rogan]: Have you thought about creating an air conditioning system? I know you have. Trick question.
[INPUT]: Cannot answer questions about the future of potential products.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay. Let's just let it go. We'll move on to the next thing.
[INPUT]: That would be an interesting idea.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I would say radiant heating and all that, good ideas. Now, when you think about the efficiency of these homes, and you think about implementing solar power and battery power, is there anything else that people are missing? Is there any other -- Like, I just saw a smartwatch that is powered by the heat of the human body, and some new technology."
[INPUT]: It's able to fully power that way?
[Joe Rogan]: I don't know-
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... if it's fully or if it's -- Like this watch right here, this is a Casio."
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's called a Pro Trek. And it's like an outdoors watch, and it's solar-powered."
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: And so, it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, if you have it exposed, it could function for a certain amount of time on solar."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Well, you know, like there's self-weighting watches where-"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: ... you know, it's just got a weight in the watch. And as you move your wrist, the way it moves from one side to the other, and it winds the watch up. That's a pretty cool thing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, yeah."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's amazing that like Rolexes that it's all done mechanically."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: There's no batteries in there. There is no nothing.
[INPUT]: Yeah. You could do the same thing. You create a little charger that's based on wrist movement. It really depends on how much energy your watch uses.
"[Joe Rogan]: You know what's fucked up about that though? We accept a certain amount of like fuckery with those watches. Like I brought my watch. I have a Rolex that my friend, Lorenzo, gave me, and I brought it to the watch store, and I said, This thing's always fast. I said, It's always like after a couple of months, it's like five minutes fast. And they go, Yup. They go, Yeah."
[INPUT]: Really?
[Joe Rogan]: It's just what it does.
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: I go, Hold on. I go, So, you're telling me that it just is always going to be fast? They're like, Yeah. It's just like every few months, you get like reset it."
[INPUT]: It seems like they should recalibrate that thing.
"[Joe Rogan]: They can't. They tried. They say, every few months, whether it's four months, or five months, or six months, it's going to be a couple of minutes fast."
[INPUT]: Okay. It seems like they should really recalibrate that because-
[Joe Rogan]: You should figure that shit out.
"[INPUT]: ... if it's always fast, you can just-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: ... you know, delete those minutes."
"[Joe Rogan]: You need to fucking kick down the door at Rolex and go, You bitches are lazy."
[INPUT]: It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears.
[Joe Rogan]: It's amazing.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I mean, the whole luxury watch market is fascinating. I'm not that involved in terms -- Like I don't buy them. I've bought them as gifts. I don't buy them for myself. But when I look at them online, there's a million dollar watches out there now that are like they have like a little rotating moons and stars."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And they live --- Like look at this thing, how much is that when Jaime?"
[INPUT]: I don't know. I just picked one.
[Joe Rogan]: These are fucking preposterous guess. I like gears. I love them. I love them.
[INPUT]: Yeah. I think that is beautiful.
"[Joe Rogan]: But there's some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass. They're buying these watches for like $750,000 . Like, Yeah, that's a Timex, son. Nobody knows. It's not any better than some Casio that you could just buy on -- Like, look at that though."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, here's the thing. If you're a person that doesn't just want to know the time, you want craftsmanship, you want some artisan's touch, you want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly, to every time it turns over, it's basically a second. I mean, that's just -- There's this art to that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I agree."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it's not just telling time. Yeah, I like this watch a lot, but if it got hit by a rock, I wouldn't be sad."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's just to watch. It's a mass-produced thing that runs on some quartz battery. But those things, there's art to that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. No, I agree. It's beautiful."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah. Love it.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. There's something amazing about it. It's-
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: Because it represents the human creativity. It's not just electronic innovation. There's something. It's a person's work in that.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: You don't have a watch on.
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: Ever?
[INPUT]: I used to have a watch.
[Joe Rogan]: What happened?
[INPUT]: My phone tells the time. So-
"[Joe Rogan]: That's a good point. Well, if you lose your phone? Do you -- Wait, hold on."
[INPUT]: It's true.
"[Joe Rogan]: Let me guess, you are a no case guy."
[INPUT]: That's correct. Living on the edge. Living on the edge without a case.
[Joe Rogan]: Neil deGrasse Tyson. Neil deGrasse Tyson was in here last week. I'm marveled at his ability to get through life without a case.
[INPUT]: That's right.
"[Joe Rogan]: You know, he takes his phone, and he flips it in between his fingers like a soldier would do with his rifle."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: He just rolls that shit in between his fingers.
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: It's marvelous.
[INPUT]: Wow.
"[Joe Rogan]: He says that's the reason why they do it. He said, Would you look at someone who has a rifle, why would they do that? Why would they flip it around like that?"
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's like, it goes to drop, they have it in their hand. They catch it quickly."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, that's what he does with his phone. He's just flipping his phone around all the time. I got that in Mexico. I was hoping it holds joint."
[INPUT]: Does it do anything? It tips to open.
[Joe Rogan]: No.
[INPUT]: Just a hole?
[Joe Rogan]: It's just a hole.
[INPUT]: You could store things in there.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. But like try it. Put a joint in there. Close it. You put like one blunt. One, that seems pretentious. You know, that's the idea behind it. I bought it when I was in Mexico because I figured it would be a good size to hold joints, or it's not."
"[INPUT]: So, is that a joint or is it a cigar?"
[Joe Rogan]: No.
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: It's marijuana inside of a tobacco.
"[INPUT]: Okay. So, it's like posh, part tobacco a pot."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. You never had that?
[INPUT]: Yeah. I think I tried one once.
"[Joe Rogan]: Come on, man. You probably can't because of stockholders, right?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, it's legal, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Totally legal.
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: How does that work? Do people get upset at you if you do certain things? It's just tobacco and marijuana in there. That's all it is. The combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful. First turned on to it by Charlie Murphy, and then reignited by Dave Chappelle. There you go."
[INPUT]: Plus whiskey.
[INPUT]: Exactly.
[Joe Rogan]: Perfect. It balances it out.
[INPUT]: Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's not just a drug. It's a drug that gets a bad rep because you just have a little, it's great."
[INPUT]: Fine.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, little sip here and there, and your inhibitions are relaxed, and it shows your true self. And, hopefully, you're more joyous, and friendly, and happy, and everything. The real worry is the people that can't handle it. Like the real worry about people who can't handle cars and go 016 in 1.9 seconds or anything."
"[Joe Rogan]: Have you ever considered something that -- Like, imagine if one day, everyone has a car that's on the same, at least, technological standard as one of your cars, and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device, something, some electromagnetic field around the cars that as cars come close to each other, they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something."
"[INPUT]: Well, I mean, our cars brake automatically."
[Joe Rogan]: Brake?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. When they see things?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: But like a physical barrier, like-"
"[INPUT]: Well, the wheels work pretty well."
[Joe Rogan]: The wheels do.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. They work pretty well. Decelerated at, you know, 1.1 to 1.2 Gs, that kind of thing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Is your concern that one day all your cars will be on the road, and then, there'll still be regular people with regular cars 20-30 years from now that will get in the mix and be the main problem?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I think, it'd be sort of like, you know, there was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at the same time. It's been pretty weird."
[Joe Rogan]: That would be the weirdest.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, horses were tricky. You know, back when Manhattan had like 300.000 horses, then figure out like if a horse lives 15 years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day or every year, I should say. Every year, it's 20,000 horses. If there's 300,000 horses in a 15-year lifespan."
"[Joe Rogan]: Back in the Gangs of New York days, that movie."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It's a lot of dead horses. You needed a horse to move the horse.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: They'll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse.
[Joe Rogan]: Do you think they know what's going on?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Do you think it's as hard?
"[INPUT]: I mean, it's got to be like pretty weird."
"[Joe Rogan]: No, I would imagine."
"[INPUT]: Like, in my mind, dragging this dead, you know, horse around, and I'm a horse."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you-
[INPUT]: They might not like it.
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization? Do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture? Because me, as a person, who never met you until today, when I think of you, you know, I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit, but there's not a lot of you out there. Like everybody else seems to be -- I mean, obviously, you make a lot of money, and there's a lot of people that make a lot of money. You like that clock?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Pretty dope, right?"
[INPUT]: This is a great clock.
[Joe Rogan]: You want one? I'll get you one.
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay, done."
[INPUT]: I like weird things like this.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, this is the coolest. It's TGT Promotion. What is this? TGT Studios? TGT Studios."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. So, a gentleman who makes all this by hand. Yeah, it's really cool."
[INPUT]: My study is filled with weird devices.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, get ready for another one."
[INPUT]: All right.
[Joe Rogan]: I'm sending it your way.
[INPUT]: Cool.
[Joe Rogan]: You want a werewolf too? I'll hook you up.
[INPUT]: All right. I'll take one.
"[Joe Rogan]: Okay. You want a werewolf and one clock coming up. Do you think about your role in the culture? Because me, as a person, who never met you until today, I've always looked at you and like, Wow. Like, How does this guy just keep inventing shit? Like, how do you how do you keep coming up with all these new devices? And do you ever consider how unusual -- Like I had a dream once that there was a million Teslas. Instead of like one Tesla, there was a million Teslas."
[INPUT]: Okay.
[Joe Rogan]: Not just the car but Nikola.
"[INPUT]: Oh, yeah, sure."
"[Joe Rogan]: And that in his day, there was a million people like him who were radically innovative."
[INPUT]: Wow.
"[Joe Rogan]: It was a weird dream, man. It was so strange. And I've had it more than once."
[INPUT]: That would result in a very rapid technology innovation. That's for sure.
[Joe Rogan]: It's one of the only dreams of my life I've had more than one time.
"[INPUT]: Okay, wow."
"[Joe Rogan]: Like where I've woken up, and it's in the same dream. I'm in the same dream. And in this dream, it's 1940s, 1950s, but everyone is severely advanced. There's flying blimps with like LCD screens in the side of them. And everything is bizarre and strange. And it stuck with me for whatever -- Obviously, this is just a stupid dream. But for whatever reason, all these years, that stuck with being. Like it takes one man, like Nikola Tesla, to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents, right. I mean, he had some-"
[INPUT]: He's pretty great.
[Joe Rogan]: ... pretty fucking amazing ideas.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: But there was-
[INPUT]: Definitely.
"[Joe Rogan]: In his day, there was very few people like him."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that was true."
[Joe Rogan]: What if there was a million? Like what in the experience-
[INPUT]: Things would advance very quickly.
"[Joe Rogan]: Right, but there's not a million Elon Musks. There's one motherfucker. Do you think about that or you just try to not?"
[INPUT]: I don't think. I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me. That'd be good.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, what's the worst part about you?"
[INPUT]: I should. I never thought people would like it that much.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, most people would, but they can't be. So, that's like some superhero type shit. You know, we wouldn't want to be Spiderman. I'd rather just sleep tight in Gotham City and hope he's out there doing his job."
[INPUT]: It's very hard to turn it off.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. What's the hardest part?
"[INPUT]: It might sound great if it's turned on, but what if it doesn't turn off?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, I showed you the isolation tank, and you've never experienced that before."
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night.
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Just give you a little bit of sleep, a little bit of perspective. It's magnesium that you get from the water as well that makes you sleep easier because the water has Epsom salts in it. But may be some sort of strategy for sacrificing your -- or not sacrificing but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way whether it's through meditation or some other ways to shut off that thing at night. Like you must have like a constant stream of ideas that's running through your head all the time. You're getting text messages from chicks."
"[INPUT]: No. I'm getting text messages from a friend saying, What the hell are you doing smoking weed?."
[Joe Rogan]: Is that bad for you? It's legal.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: I mean-
[Joe Rogan]: It's government approved.
"[INPUT]: It's not -- You know, I'm not a regular smoker of weed."
[Joe Rogan]: How often do you smoke it?
"[INPUT]: Almost never. I mean, it's-"
[Joe Rogan]: How does it feel?
[INPUT]: I don't actually notice any effect.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, there you go. There was a time where I think it was Ramadan for someone gave some Buddhist monk a bunch of acid."
[INPUT]: Okay.
"[Joe Rogan]: And he ate it, and it had no effect on him."
[INPUT]: I doubt that.
"[Joe Rogan]: I would say that too, but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people have where they're constantly meditating all day. They don't have any material possessions. And all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. I would like to cynically deny that. I'd like to cynically say, Hey, just fuck and think the same way I do. They're just hanging out with flip flops on and make weird noises, but maybe no."
"[INPUT]: You know, I know a lot of people like weed, and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity."
[Joe Rogan]: For you.
[INPUT]: Not for me.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I mean, I would imagine that for someone like you, it's not. For someone like you, it would be more like a cup of coffee, right. You want to have a latte."
[INPUT]: Yeah. It's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee.
[Joe Rogan]: What is that?
[INPUT]: It's like a cup of coffee in reverse.
[Joe Rogan]: Weed is?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: No, I'm saying you would like more. More like will be beneficial to you. It would be like coffee."
[INPUT]: I like to get things done. I like to be useful. That is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful.
[Joe Rogan]: When you say you like to get things done-
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... like, in terms of like what-"
[INPUT]: I should get things done.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... gives you satisfaction? When you complete a project, when something that you invent comes to fruition, and you see people enjoying it, that feeling."
"[INPUT]: Yes, doing something useful for other people that I like doing."
[Joe Rogan]: That's interesting for other people.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, that, do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this? I mean, you essentially have a gift, right."
[INPUT]: Sure.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, you would think it was a curse, but I'm sure it's been fueled by many, many years of discipline and learning. But you, essentially, have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. It's like you're just you're going at very high RPMs."
[INPUT]: All the time. That doesn't stop.
[Joe Rogan]: What is that like?
[INPUT]: I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank.
[Joe Rogan]: Let's try it.
[INPUT]: It sounds a little concerning.
[Joe Rogan]: But why?
[INPUT]: It's like running the engine with no resistance. That is-
[Joe Rogan]: Is that what it is though? Maybe it's not.
[INPUT]: Maybe it's fine. I don't know.
[Joe Rogan]: How much-
[INPUT]: I'll try it. I'll try it.
[Joe Rogan]: Have you ever-
[INPUT]: It's fine.
[Joe Rogan]: ... experimented with meditation or anything?
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: What do you do, or what have you done rather?"
"[INPUT]: I mean, just sort of sit there, and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point. It does still the mind. It does still the mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means. Like, what are you trying to achieve when you're meditating all the time? With you, it seems like almost like there's a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this burning furnace. And in order for you to like calm that thing down, you might have to throw too much water on it."
[INPUT]: It's like a never-ending explosion.
[Joe Rogan]: Like what is it like? Try to explain it to a dumb person like me. What's going on?
[INPUT]: Never-ending explosion.
[Joe Rogan]: It's just constant ideas just bouncing around.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Damn.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, when everybody leaves, it's just Elon sitting at home brushing his teeth, just bunch ideas bouncing around your head."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, all the time."
[Joe Rogan]: When did you realize that that's not the case with most people?
"[INPUT]: I think, when I was, I don't know, five or six or something. I thought I was insane."
[Joe Rogan]: Why did you think you were insane?
[INPUT]: Because it is clear that other people do not. Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, they weren't expressing it. They weren't talking about it all day. And you realized by the time you were five or six like, Oh, they're probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting."
"[INPUT]: No. It was just strange. It was like, Hmm, kind of strange. That was my conclusion, kind of strange."
"[Joe Rogan]: But did you feel diminished by it in any way? Like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with other people, they wouldn't understand you."
[INPUT]: I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away or something.
[Joe Rogan]: You thought that?
"[INPUT]: For a second, yes."
[Joe Rogan]: When you were little?
[INPUT]: Yeah. They put people away. What if they put me away?
"[Joe Rogan]: Like when you were little, you thought this?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Wow. Well, you thought, This is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out I got this stream coming in."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa.
"[INPUT]: But, you know, I was only like five or six probably."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you think this is like -- I mean, there's outliers biologically. You mean, there's people that are 7 foot 9, there's people that have giant hands, there's people that have eyes that are 20/15 vision. There's always the outliers. Do you feel like you like caught this, like you have got some -- you're like on some weird innovation creativity sort of wave that's very unusual? Like you tapped into -- I mean, just think of the various things you may have accomplished in a very short amount of time, and you're constantly doing this. That's a weird -- You're a weird person, right."
"[INPUT]: Right, I agree."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Like what if there's a million Elon Musks?
"[INPUT]: Well, that would be very, very weird."
[Joe Rogan]: Whoa.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it would be pretty weird. I agree."
[Joe Rogan]: Real weird.
[INPUT]: Definitely.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: What if there were a million Joe Rogans?
"[Joe Rogan]: There probably is. There's probably two million. I mean, I think that's the case with a lot of folks."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, but, like, you know, my goal is like try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability for the future's good, make the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know. You know, with Tesla, I want to try to make things that people love. Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things. That's what we try to do. Just make things that somebody loves."
[Joe Rogan]: When you-
[INPUT]: That's so difficult.
"[Joe Rogan]: When you think about things that someone loves, like, do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's experience, like what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy? You really think, like, when you're thinking about things like that, is that like one of your considerations? Like what could I do that would help people-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: ... that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure out?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like, you know, like so, I think, a future where we are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars. This is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future. This makes me want that future. You know, the things, there need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning."
"[INPUT]: You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to the future. And a future where we are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting. That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad, I think."
[Joe Rogan]: It would be so sad in terms-
[INPUT]: Like I don't want a sad future.
[Joe Rogan]: ... just the finite lifespan of the Earth itself-
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: ... and the solar system itself. But even though it's possibly -- You know, I mean, how long do they feel like the sun and the solar system is going to exist? How many hundreds of millions of years?"
"[INPUT]: Well, it's probably, if you're saying when does the sun boil the oceans-"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: About 500 million years.
"[Joe Rogan]: So, is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years, that happens? Is that what you're saying?"
"[INPUT]: No. I just think like if there are two futures, and one future us we're out there among the stars, and the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones are true, and we have these starships, and we're going see what other planets are like, and we're a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations, and many planets, and many star systems, this is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me. And that's what we should strive for."
[Joe Rogan]: But that's biological travel. That's cells traveling physically to another location.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Do you think that's definitely where we're going?
[INPUT]: No.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I don't think so either. I used to think so. And, now, I'm thinking more likely less than ever. Like almost every day less likely."
[INPUT]: We can definitely go to the moon and Mars.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Do you think we will colonize?
"[INPUT]: I think we will go to the asteroid belt. And we can go to the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, even get to Pluto."
"[Joe Rogan]: That'd be the craziest place ever if we colonize Mars, and reform it, and turn it into like a big Jamaica. Just oceans and-"
"[INPUT]: I think, we should. I think that would be great."
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, imagine that there is-"
[INPUT]: That would be great. Amazing.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's possible, right?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: We can turn the whole thing into Cancún.
[INPUT]: Well-
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, over time."
[INPUT]: It wouldn't be easy but yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: You could just warm -- You could warm it up.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, you can warm it up. You could add air. You get some water there. I mean, over time, hundreds of millions of years or whatever it takes."
[INPUT]: We'll be a multi-planet species.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, that would be amazing."
[INPUT]: We're a multi-planet species.
[Joe Rogan]: If we could-
[INPUT]: That's what we want to be-
[Joe Rogan]: ... legitimately like air-condition-
[INPUT]: Great.
[Joe Rogan]: ... Saturn.
[INPUT]: I'm pro-human.
"[Joe Rogan]: Me too. Yeah, me too."
[INPUT]: I love humanity. I think it's great.
"[Joe Rogan]: We're glad as a robot that you love humans because we love you too, and we don't want you to kill us and eat us. And-"
"[INPUT]: I mean, you know, strangely, I think a lot of people don't like humanity and see it as a blight, but I do not."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, I think one of those -- I think, part of that is just they've been -- you know, they've been struggling. When people struggle, they associate their struggle with other people. They never internalize their problems. They look to other people as holding them back, and people suck, and fuck people, and it's just -- You know, it's a never ending cycle. But not always. Again, most people are really good. Most people, the vast majority."
[INPUT]: This may sound corny.
[Joe Rogan]: It does sound corny.
[INPUT]: But love is the answer.
[Joe Rogan]: It is you answer.
[INPUT]: Yup.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it is. It sounds corny because we're all scared. You know, we're all scared of trying to love people, being rejected, or someone taking advantage of you because you're trying to be loving."
[INPUT]: Sure.
[Joe Rogan]: What if we all could just relax and love each other?
[INPUT]: It wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world.
[Joe Rogan]: It definitely wouldn't hurt.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It would be great.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, we should do that."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I agree, man."
[INPUT]: Like really.
[Joe Rogan]: How are you going to fix that? Do you have a love machine you're working on?
"[INPUT]: No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now, deleting social media from your applications, from your phones, will that give you a 10% boost to happiness? What do you think the percentage is?"
"[INPUT]: I think probably something like that, yeah."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, a good 10%."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I mean, the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out, you know."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Well, that's about it. So far so good."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, what's interesting with you, you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, that's-"
[Joe Rogan]: What percentage of that is a good idea?
[INPUT]: Good question.
"[Joe Rogan]: Probably 10%, right? It's hard."
"[INPUT]: It's mostly -- I think, it's on balance, more good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So-."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you ever-
"[INPUT]: Hopefully, the good outweighs the bad."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you ever think about how odd it is, the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to you on Twitter, and you read it? That weird feeling. This weird little negative jolt. It's like a subjective negative jolt of energy that you don't really need to absorb, but you do anyway. Like, I want to fuck this guy. Fuck him."
"[INPUT]: I mean, there's a lot of negativity on Twitter."
"[Joe Rogan]: It is, but it's a weird in it's form. Like the way, if you ingest it as if you're like -- you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it, you're like, How weird is this? And I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me. It's not even accurate."
"[INPUT]: I mean, the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Every now and again, you have draw in, something not good."
[Joe Rogan]: It's not good.
[INPUT]: You make mistakes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes, you can make mistakes."
[INPUT]: We can make some mistakes.
"[Joe Rogan]: We're all human. We can make mistakes. Yeah, it's hard. And people love it when you say something, and you take it back, and they're like, Fuck you. We saved it forever. I'll fucking screenshot that shit, bitch. You had that thought. You had that thought. I'm like, Well, I deleted it. Not good enough. You had the thought. I'm better than you. I never had that thought. You had that thought, you piece of shit. Look, I saved it. I put it on my blog. Bad thought."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away. It's like, Hello, been on the internet for a while."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Well it's even like-
[INPUT]: Anything is forever.
"[Joe Rogan]: And the thing is they don't want you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it, and you don't believe it anymore, it's really hard to say, Hey, that thing above, I don't really believe that anymore. I changed the way I view things."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Because people would go, Well, fuck you. I have that over there. I'm going to just take that. I'm not going to pay attention to that shit you wrote underneath it."
[INPUT]: It's on your permanent record.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. It's forever like a tattoo.
"[INPUT]: Like high school, We'll put this on your permanent record."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. It's like a tattoo. You keep it.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Well, it's this thing where there's a lack of compassion. It's a lack of compassion issue. People are just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online, and trying to catch-"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: They're more trying to catch people doing something that's arrestable, like a cop trying to, like, get, you know, arrests on his record. It's like they're trying to catch you for something, more than they're logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done, or that it's an idea they don't agree with so much, they needed to insult you. They're trying to catch you."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Way easier.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It's weird. It's not a normal way of human interacting. It's cheating.
[INPUT]: True.
[Joe Rogan]: You're not supposed to be able to interact so easily when the people are not looking at.
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: You would never do that. Don't be so mean when somebody looking in their eyes. If you did, you'd feel like shit."
[INPUT]: Most people.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, unless you're a sociopath, you'd feel terrible."
[INPUT]: Yes.
"[Joe Rogan]: Elon Musk, this has been a pleasure."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, likewise."
[Joe Rogan]: It really has been.
[INPUT]: It's been an honor. Thank you for having me.
"[Joe Rogan]: Thanks for doing this because I know you don't do a lot of long form stuff like this. I hope I didn't weird you out, and I hope you don't get mad that you smoked weed."
[INPUT]: I mean-
[Joe Rogan]: It's not bad. It's legal. We're in California. This is just as legal as this whiskey we've been drinking.
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: This is all good, right?"
[INPUT]: Cheers.
"[Joe Rogan]: Cheers. Thank you. Is there any message you would like to put out other than love is the answer, because I think you really nailed it with that."
"[INPUT]: No. I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just, it's easy to demonize people. You're usually wrong about it. People are nicer than you think. Give people more credit."
"[Joe Rogan]: I couldn't agree more. And I want to thank you not just for all the crazy innovations you've come up with and your constant flow of ideas but that you choose to spread that idea, which is very vulnerable, but it's very honest, and it resonates with me."
[INPUT]: It's true.
[Joe Rogan]: And I believe it.
[INPUT]: It's true.
"[Joe Rogan]: I believe it's true too. So, thank you."
[INPUT]: You're welcome.
"[Joe Rogan]: All you assholes out there, be nice. Be nice, bitch. All right. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Elon."
"[INPUT]: All right, thank you."
"[Joe Rogan]: Two, one, boom. All right, we're live. Thank you very much for doing this, man. I really appreciate it. I've been absorbing your information and listening to you talk for quite a while now. So, it's great to actually meet you."
[INPUT]: Thanks for having me.
"[Joe Rogan]: My pleasure. My pleasure. You are one of the rare guys that is -- you're a big investor. You're deep in the tech world, but yet you seem to have a very balanced perspective in terms of how to live life, as opposed to not just be entirely focused on success and financial success, and tech investing, but rather how to live your life in a happy way. That's not balance."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I think the reason why people like hearing me is because it's like if you go to a circus and you see a bear, right? That's kind of interesting but not that much. If you see a unicycle, that's interesting. But you see a bear on a unicycle, that's really interesting, right? So, when you combine things you're not supposed to combine --"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: -- people get interested. It's like Bruce Lee, right? Striking thoughts, philosophy, plus martial arts. And I think it's because at some level, all humans are broad. We're all multivariate, but we get summarized in pithy ways in our lives. And at some deep level, we know that's not true, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Every human basically is capable of every experience and every thought. You're a UFC, comedian, commentator, podcaster, but you're also more than that. You're also Father, lover, thinker, et cetera. So, I like the model of life that the ancients had, the Greeks, the Romans, right? Where you would start out and when you're, young you're just like going to school, then you're going to war, then you're running a business, then you're supposed to serve in the Senate or the government, then you become a philosopher, there's sort of this arc to life where you try your hand at everything. And as one of my friends says, Specialization is for insects. So, everyone should just be able to do everything. And so, I don't believe in this model anymore of trying to focus your life down on one thing. You've got one life, just do everything you're going to do."
"[Joe Rogan]: I couldn't agree more. And I think that sometimes people find certain success in whatever the endeavor is and then they think that that is their niche, and they stick with it, and they never change, and they did it almost out of fear."
"[INPUT]: But it's hard because there is a -- the analogy around mountain climbing. It's like if you find a mountain and you start climbing and you spend your whole life climbing it, and you get, say, 2/3 of the way, and then you see the peak is like way up there, but you're 2/3 of the way up. You still really high up, but now to go the rest of the way, you're going to have to go back down to the bottom and look for another path. Nobody wants to do that. People don't want to start over."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And it's the nature of later in life that you just don't have the time. So it's very painful to go back down and look for a new path, but that may be the best thing to do. And that's why when you look at the greatest artists and creators, they have this ability to start over that nobody else does. Like Elon will be called an idiot and start over, doing something brand new that he supposedly is not qualified for. Or when Madonna or Paul Simon or U2 come out the new album, their existing fans usually hate it, because they've adopted a completely new style that they've learned somewhere else."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And a lot of times they'll just miss completely. So you have to be willing to be a fool and kind of have that beginner's mind and go back to the beginning to start over. If not doing that, you're just getting older."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I mean, I don't even know if it's willing to be a fool. It's just, to me, that the most exciting thing is to try to get better at something, to learn things. I mean, it's really exciting when you just have incremental progress in something that you're completely new to."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I live for the aha moment, that moment when you connect two things together that you hadn't connected together before and it fits nicely and solidly and it kind of helps form a steel framework of understanding in your mind that you can then hang other ideas off of. That's what I live for."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It's like, curiosity fulfilled. It's what little children do too. You know, my little son is always asking why, why, why, why, why. And I always try and answer him. And half the times I realized actually I don't really understand why, I just have a memorized answer for you, but that's not really understanding."
"[Joe Rogan]: You know those are weird conversations, right? When you're talking to kids and you say, Look, the reality is, I don't know a lot of things."
[INPUT]: Yeah. I just memorize a lot of things. Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And there's certain things that you just can't know.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, you realize that you have answers for a few things that you've thought through then you sort of have cover ups, like trapdoors, like don't go here. This is just a cover up. I don't really know the answer to --"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: -- what the meaning of life is or how we got here.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And then you've got a whole bunch of memorized stuff because a lot of your -- a lot of intelligence these days just the external brain pack of civilization. I know it's out there. I know the answers are out there, and I have to look them up and I've memorized some of them. And I kind of understand how money works and the Federal Reserve prints it and what this government thing is, but not really."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: So.
[Joe Rogan]: Not good enough to teach it in university.
[INPUT]: Exactly. Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I think people do that with almost everything in life these days, in terms of like have like a one page, a one sheet, like a brief summary of what the explanation for what this very complex subject might be."
"[INPUT]: Tl;dr, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Don't give me the lecture, give me the book. Don't give me the book, give me the blog post."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Don't give me the blog post, give me the tweet. Don't give me the tweet -- I just -- I already know."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I got really fascinated by the way you read, because I thought there was something wrong with me by doing that. But you don't really just read a book to completion, you read and then you pick something else up and you just kind of go based on your whims, whatever you're interested in."
"[INPUT]: I was raised by my -- I was raised by a single mom in New York, and she used the local library as a daycare center, because it was a very tough neighborhood. And so she would basically say, When you get back from school, go straight to a library and don't come out until I pick you up late at night. So I used to basically live in the library, and I read everything; I read every magazine, I read every pictograph, I read every book, I read every map. I just went up stuff to read. I just read everything. So I got over this idea of that reading a large number of books or reading a book to completion as a vanity metric. Because really, when people are putting up photos on Twitter, Instagram, and look at my pile of books that I'm reading, it's a show off thing. It's a similar thing, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Sure.
"[INPUT]: And the reality is, I would rather read the best 100 books over and over again until I absorbed them, rather than read all the books."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Because your brain has finite information. Finite space. You get enough advice, it all cancels to zero. There's a lot of nonsense in books out there too. So I don't read anymore to complete books, I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity. And it can be anything; it could be nonsense, it could be history, could be fiction, it could be science, it could be sci-fi. These days it's mostly sci-fi philosophy science because that's just what I'm interested in, but I will read for understanding. So, a really good book, I will flip through. I won't actually read it consecutive in order and I won't even [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. You brought up two awesome points. First of all, the social media aspect of books and basically anything. It's like, it's such a weird way to display your life because, you know, you're displaying the best aspects of your life and some sort of a glass case, you know, just, it's an unrealistic version of your life that you cultivate and you curate."
[INPUT]: And I'm as guilty of that as anybody.
[Joe Rogan]: Everybody's guilty of it. I'm guilty of it too.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, I pose with my dog every time I run."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. We're always signaling, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It's like, rather than really looking at yourself, you're looking at how other people look at you. It's like this one remove mental image. And it's kind of a disease because social media is making celebrities of all of us, and celebrity is the most miserable people in the world, right? Because they're this strong self image that gets built up, it gets built up by compliments. Every time somebody pays you or me a compliment and we're like, Oh, well, thank you. Right? Then that builds up an image of who we are. And then one idiot comes along, one out of ten, one out of 100, and they can easily tear it down. Because it doesn't take many insults to cancel out a lot of compliments. And now you're carrying around this big weighty self image, and it's just very easy to be attacked. And because you're famous or you're well known people want to attack you. So, being a celebrity is no good. It's actually a problem. Like, one of my tweets is -- these are all reminders to myself, is, You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous."
[Joe Rogan]: There's benefits to it.
[INPUT]: Of course. Of course.
[Joe Rogan]: But --
[INPUT]: We wouldn't do it.
"[Joe Rogan]: It has unusual problems that you don't get trained for, and you really will not understand unless you experience it. You know, it goes having this conversation with my wife. We're talking about people that just come up to you and they don't care what you're doing. They don't care if I'm with my daughter, if I'm holding her, if I'm feeding her, if we're, you know, we're in the middle of an intense conversation. She's crying. She could be crying. And some bro will come over and just immediately have to take a picture, doesn't care, his needs supersede the daughter. And my wife is saying that before she knew me she used to think that that's just part of the price of being famous, that people like you. That's just part of the price being famous. And now when it interrupts her life, and, you know, it interrupts the children interrupts friends and, you know, she -- now she's like, This is annoying. Like this is not healthy. This is not a smart way to interact with people. And that people have this weird challenge, this weird thing that if you become famous, there's this weird challenge where people just want to come to you. Especially today. Because if they get a photo of you, then that boost their social media profile. Like, Hey I'm sitting here with [inaudible 0[INPUT]: Anonymity is a privilege. On the other hand it's self-inflicted."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes. Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I mean, we brought it on ourselves."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. I don't think we knew what it was though.
"[INPUT]: We did. But we carry on, so."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It tells us we are getting something out of it, so."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: You know, there are times when some someone approach me in public and I'm a little resentful. And there are other times I just like actually, I'm really grateful that, you know, I worked for this. I got this."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: This is the payoff, just embrace it, smile, grin and bear it."
"[Joe Rogan]: But you have a different sort of celebrity too, right? You're a hero amongst investors and amongst -- I mean, you've just been part of --"
[INPUT]: I'm a hero among young male geeks. Which is --
[Joe Rogan]: Those are some of my favorite people.
[INPUT]: Right. But that's not the kind of celebrity I think most people set out to get.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Especially most guys.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right.
[INPUT]: You want the cute females.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, you want chicks."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Yeah, I look at my brief little YouTube clips that have a tiny little podcast going now, and it's like 95% male."
[Joe Rogan]: Sure. Yeah.
[INPUT]: Maybe the --
[Joe Rogan]: This is very highly --
[INPUT]: 18 to 35.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. What do we -- What does the numbers? Yeah. It's in the 90s.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: You do that one very small podcast where you just have small with three or four minute clips.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. So what it was, I did a tweet storm called[Joe Rogan]: Yeah."
"[INPUT]: That's the trifecta. Now of course you also want to internally calm state of mind, you want a loving household. So there are other things that come into it. But those three, I think they can actually be taught, right? And a fitness, I'm not going to teach. There a lot of people who you've had on here including yourself who know a heck of a lot more about fitness and health than I do. But I was born poor and miserable and I'm now pretty well off and I'm very happy. And I worked at those, and so I've learned a few things. There are some principles. And so I try to lay them out, but in a timeless manner where you can kind of figure it out yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can't really teach anything, I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks, so you can remember things when they happen, or put a name to them. So this podcast actually ended up explaining this tweet storm. So there's a tweet storm with like 36, 38 tweets, got very famous, got translated in dozens of languages. And these were principles that I came up with for myself when I was really young, around 13, 14. And I've been carrying them in my head for 30 years and I'd been sort of living them. And over time I just realized, like, sadly, or fortunately, the thing that I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that. And do it in very long term kind of way, not the, you know, banker crash the economy."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right.
"[INPUT]: Get build up kind of way. But, you know, build businesses and help people and provide value kind of way. Especially when applied to modern technology and leverage in this age of infinite leverage that we live in. So the podcast is just explaining each tweet. So these a little three, four, five minute snippets. I don't like to say the same thing twice. I don't like to explain in detail. I just -- I feel like, if you have something original and interesting to say, you should say it. Otherwise it's probably been said better. So that podcast tries to be information dense. It tries to be very concise, it tries to be high impact, it tries to be timeless, and it has all the information. I think you need the principle that if you absorbed these, and you work hard over 10 years, you'll get what you want. So I've got the one on wealth creation, I'm going to attempt to do one on -- happiness is a big word but -- you know, happiness and inner peace and calm and all that. Because what you want is you don't want to be the guy who succeeds in life while being high strung, high stress, and unhappy and leaving a trail of emotional wreckage with you and your loved ones."
[Joe Rogan]: Which is more common than not.
[INPUT]: Because you got to focus.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And it's very hard to be great at everything. You want to be the guy or the gal who gets there calmly, you know, quietly, without struggle. You want to be the person who's the -- when there's a crisis going on, you want to be the calmest, coolest cucumber in the room who still also figures out the correct answer."
"[Joe Rogan]: If you can be. You were -- One of the things you were saying is that you feel like happiness is something that you can learn, and then you can teach yourself to be happy, even just by adopting the mindset that you are a happy person and proclaiming that to your friends. And so you've sort of developed a social contract. I'm a happy person. And I have to live up to that."
[INPUT]: Yeah. I've got hundreds of techniques. But the mo-
[Joe Rogan]: How did you develop that one?
"[INPUT]: Well, there's just a -- There's social consistency, right? Humans have a need to be highly consistent with their past pronouncements. So the way I started my first tech company was I was in a -- working inside a larger organization, and I told everybody that I was going to start a company. I was like, I hate this place. I'm gonna do my own thing. I'm gonna be a successful entrepreneur. Six months passed, nine months pass, then people started, You're still here? I thought you were gonna go start a company. Are you lying?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Right.
"[INPUT]: That was the implication. So we kind of know this, right? Social contracts are very powerful. Like if you want to give up drinking, right? And you're not serious about it, you'll say, I'm gonna cut back, and then I have only one drink a night, I'm gonna only drink on weekends. You tell yourself. But if you're serious, you announce it on Facebook. You'll tell your friends, you'll tell your wife, you'll say, I'm done drinking. I'm throwing everything out of the house. You'll never see me drink again. When you say that you know you're serious. So I think a lot of these are choices that we make. And happiness is just one of those choices. And this is unpopular to say because there are people who are actually depressed, you know, chemically or what have you. And there are people who don't believe that it's possible because then it creates a responsibility on them. It says, Oh now, if I'm -- you're saying if I'm not happy, that's my fault. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that, just like fitness can be a choice, health can be a choice, nutrition can be a choice, working hard and making money can be a choice, happiness is also a choice. If you're so smart, how come you aren't happy? How come you haven't figured that out? That's my challenge to all the people who think they're so smart and so capable. If you're so smart and capable, why can't you change this?"
"[Joe Rogan]: There are a bunch of people though that actually take pleasure in being miserable. There's something about the pursuit of excellence and of success that supersedes all other pursuits, that in their eyes, it is the peak, the pinnacle, the most important thing."
"[INPUT]: It's not a tradeoff. I would argue that I -- Now, when I say happy, happy is one of those words that means a bazillion different things."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: It's like love, right? What does that mean?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right. I love cheese.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I find it a little bit more tightly, right? So let's go back to desire, right? This is old, old Buddhist wisdom. I'm not saying anything original. But desire, to me, is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. Okay? And I keep that in front of minds. So when I'm unhappy about something, I look for what is the underlying desire that I have that's not being fulfilled. It's okay to have desires. You're a biological creature, and you put on this earth, you have to do something, you have to have desires, you have a mission. But don't have too many. Don't pick them up unconsciously. Don't pick them up randomly. Don't have thousands of them. My coffee's too cold, doesn't taste quite right. I'm not sitting perfectly. Oh, I wish it was warmer. You know. My dog, you know, pooped in the lawn, I don't like that. Whatever it is. Pick your one overwhelming desire. It's okay to suffer over that one, but on all the others, do you want to let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed? And then you'll perform a better job. Most people, when you're unhappy, like a depressed person, it's not that they have very clear calm mind. They're too busy in their mind. Their sense of self is too strong. They're sitting indoors all the time. Their minds working, working, working. They're thinking too much. Well, if you want to be a high performance athlete, how good of an athlete are you gonna be if you're always having epileptic seizures? If you're always like twitching and running around and like jumping, and your limbs or flailing out of control? The same way if you want to be effective in business, you need a clear, calm, cool, collected mind. Warren Buffett plays bridge all day long and goes for walks in the sun. He doesn't sit around like constantly loading his brain with non-stop information and getting worked up about every little thing. We live in an age of infinite leverage. What I mean by that is that your actions can be multiplied a thousand fold, either by broadcasting at a podcast or by investing capital or by having people work for you or by writing code. So because of that, the impacts of good decision making are much higher than they used to be. Because now you can influence thousands or millions of people through your decisions or your code. So, a clear mind leads to better judgment, leads to a better outcome. So a happy, calm, peaceful person, will make better decisions and have better outcomes. So if you want to operate at peak performance, you have to learn how to tame your mind just like you've learned how to tame your body."
[Joe Rogan]: I love what you're saying. Warren Buffett might not be the best example because he drinks like I think six Coca-Cola is a day and he eats mostly McDonald's.
[INPUT]: And he's still alive somehow.
[Joe Rogan]: It's amazing.
[INPUT]: It shows you that low stress is more important than --
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, but he looks like shit. Like, how old is he? I mean, he's a fairly old man, right?"
"[INPUT]: But Charlie Munger is I think in his 90s, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: He's made it really far.
"[Joe Rogan]: I wonder what Warren's doing, you know. I mean, just, he's got to know that's bad for him."
[INPUT]: It's terrible.
[Joe Rogan]: But he doesn't care.
[INPUT]: He doesn't care. I think he's just low stress.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Stress is the big cure.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. So he's just enjoys that Coca-Cola.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And that's a problem. Maybe there is a tradeoff, right? It may be him enjoying that junk food and that coke, just that the pleasing of the mind is maybe better than him just eating wheat-grass shots and --"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, and be miserable."
"[Joe Rogan]: -- canned salads and just being -- Yeah, just super worked up about everything."
"[INPUT]: It's like if you need your glass of red wine to de-stress and calm down, that's probably better than you flying off the rails."
"[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right. And I think that that's applicable not just in business but in probably any pursuit. And I like what you're saying about allow that one thing to be your obsession, but everything else just, you know, learn how to let things go. Pick your battles."
"[INPUT]: And we'd like to think that -- we'd like to view the world as linear, which is, I'm gonna put in eight hours of work, I'm gonna get back eight hours of output, right? Doesn't work that way. Guy running the corner grocery store is working just as hard or harder than you and me. How much output is he getting? What you do, who you do it with. How you do it, way more important than how hard you work, right? Outputs are non-linear based on the quality of the work that you put in. The right way to work is like a lion. You don't -- you and I are not like cows. We're not meant to graze all day, right? We're meant to hunt like lions. We're closer to carnivores in our omnivorous development than we are to herbivores."
[Joe Rogan]: Don't tell vegans that.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, sorry. Look, I wish all that stuff worked. I don't want to eat meat. Future generations will look back at us as worse than slavers, you know, because the holocaust were committing with the animals, but they'll have artificial meat to taste and are healthier, it is better than the real thing, so."
[Joe Rogan]: Allegedly.
"[INPUT]: Allegedly. But, so, as a modern knowledge worker athlete, as an intellectual athlete, you want to function like an athlete. Which means you train hard, then you sprint, then you rest, then you reassessed. You get a feedback loop, then you train some more, then you sprint again, then you rest, then you reassess. This idea that you're going to have linear output just by cranking every day at the same amount of time sitting -- that's that's machines, you know. Machines should be working 9[Joe Rogan]: No, I agree wholeheartedly. But that's -- for people that are working for someone, there's not really that option."
"[INPUT]: So that's unfortunately the the rub, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: That's kind of where my tweet storm starts. Which is first of all, the first thing if you're gonna make money is that you're not gonna get rich renting out your time. Even lawyers and doctors who are charging 3- 4- 500 dollars an hour, they're not getting rich because their lifestyle is slowly ramping up --"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: -- along with their income, and they're not saving enough. They just don't have that bit of retire. So the first thing you have to do is you have to own a piece of a business. You need to have equity, either as an owner, an investor, shareholder or a brand that you're building that accrues to you to gain your financial freedom."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And I was really fascinated by another thing that you were bringing up about working for yourself that you feel in the future whether it's 50 or 100 years from now, virtually everyone is going to be working for themselves. And believe the way you put it is that the information age is gonna reverse the industrial age."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. If you go back to hunter gatherer times, how we evolved, we basically worked for ourselves. We communicated and cooperated within tribes, but each hunter, each gatherer, stood on their own, and then combined their resources of the family unit. But there was no boss, hierarchy, hierarchy, hierarchy."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Where you're like the third middle manager down. In the farming age, we became a little bit more hierarchical as we had to run farms, but even those were still mostly family farms. It's industrial work with factories that sort of created this model of thousands of people working together on one thing and having bosses at schedules and times to show up. The reality is, if you have to go -- I don't care how rich you are. I don't care whether you're like a top Wall Street banker. If you have to go -- If somebody has to tell you -- Somebody can tell you when to be at work and what to wear and how to behave, you're not a free person."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You're not actually rich. So we're in this model now where we think it's all about employment and jobs. And intrinsic in that is that I have to work for somebody else. But the information age is breaking that down. So Ronald Coase is an economist who has this coast here and a very famous theorem, but he basically just talks about why is a company the size that it is. Why is a company one person, instead of ten people, instead of one hundred, instead of a thousand. And it has to do with the internal transaction costs which is the external transaction costs. Let's say I want to do something -- let's say I'm building a house, and I need someone to come in and provide the lumber. I'm a developer, right? Do I want that to be part of my company? Or do I want that to be an external provider? A lot of it just depends on how hard it is to do that transaction with someone externally versus internally. If it's too hard to keep doing the contract every time externally, I'll bring that in-house. If it's easy to do externally and it's a one-off kind of thing, I'd rather keep it out of the house. Well, information technology is making it easier and easier to do these transactions externally. It's becoming much easier to communicate with people. Gig economy, I can send you small amounts of money, I can hire you through an app, I can rate you afterwards. So we're seeing an atomization of the firm. We're seeing the optimal size of the firms shrinking. It's most obvious in Silicon Valley. Tons and tons of startups constantly coming up and shaving off little pieces of businesses from large companies and turning them into huge markets. So what look like the small little vacation rental market on Craigslist is now suddenly blown up into Airbnb. It's just one example."
[Joe Rogan]: That's great example.
"[INPUT]: But what I think we're going to see is whether it's 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now, high quality work will be available. We're not talking about I'm driving an Uber, we're talking about super high quality work will be available in a gig fashion, where you'll wake up in the morning, your phone will buzz and you'll have five different jobs from people who have worked within the past or have been referred to you. It's kind of how Hollywood already works a little bit with how they organize for a project, you decide whether to take the project or not. The contract is right there on the spot. You get paid a certain amount. You get rated every day or every week. You get the money delivered. And then when you're done working, you turn it off and you go to Tahiti or wherever you want to spend the next three months. And I think the smart people have already started figuring out that the internet enables this. And they're starting to work more and more remotely on their own schedule, on their own time, on their own place, with their own friends, in their own way. And that's actually how we are the most productive. So the information revolution by making easier to communicate, connect and cooperate, is allowing us to go back to working for ourselves. And that is my ultimate dream. Even when I run a company and I have employees, I always tell those people, Hey, I'm gonna help you start your company when you're ready. Because I think that's the highest calling. Maybe not everybody will get there, but it would be fine if we were -- even working at 10 person company or 20 person company is way better than working in 1,000 person company or 10,000 person company. So this idea that we're all factory, like cogs in a machine, who are specialized and have to do things by rote memorization or instruction is gonna go away and we're gonna go back to being small groups of creative bands of individuals, setting out to do missions. And when those missions are done, we collect our money, we get rated, and then we rest and reassess until we're ready for the next sprint."
[Joe Rogan]: Has there ever been a study done on happiness as it regards the size of companies?
"[INPUT]: Not that I'm aware, but to me it's obvious. It's just obvious. The smaller, the company the happy you're gonna be, the more human your relations are."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: The less you have rules to operate under the more flexible, the more creative. The more you'll be treated like a human just because you're able to do multiple things."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. This brings me to what is a subject that keeps getting brought up nowadays is universal basic income with the oncoming --
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: -- apocalypse of automation. This is how it's being portrayed by Andrew Yang who's running for president. I sat down and talked to them about it, it's very compelling. And he's a very smart guy. And he's an entrepreneur himself. And when he starts talking about automation and how it's going to just eliminate massive amounts of jobs and leave people stranded, what -- do you -- I know you're a guy who thinks about the future."
[INPUT]: I'm gonna brought the unpopular point of view on this.
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: I think it's a non-solution to a non-problem. And I mean that in the sense that automation has been happening since the dawn of time. When electricity came along, that put a lot of people out of work."
[Joe Rogan]: Did it?
"[INPUT]: Right? A lot of people carrying buckets of water and, you know, lighting lamps and all those kinds of things."
[Joe Rogan]: And this was the concern with factories as well.
[INPUT]: Yeah. Abs- Everything. Literally every single thing that comes along.
"[Joe Rogan]: Even the printing press, right?"
"[INPUT]: Absolutely. And what it does is it frees people up for new creative work. The question is not, is automation gonna eliminate jobs? There is no finite number of jobs."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: We're not like sitting around dividing up the same jobs that were around since the Stone Age. So obviously new jobs are being created and they're usually better jobs, more creative jobs. So the question is, how quickly is this transition going to happen? And what kinds of jobs will be eliminated? What kinds of jobs will be created? It's impossible looking forward to predict what kinds of jobs will be created. If I told you ten years ago that podcast was gonna be a job or that, you know, playing video games gonna be a job, or commentating on video games is gonna be a job, you would have laughed me out of the room."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Those are nonsense jobs. But yet here we are. So society will always create new jobs, civilization creates new jobs, but it's impossible to predict what those jobs are. So the question is, how quickly is that transition happening? Well, the reality is even though everybody keeps talking about this automation apocalypse, where did record low unemployment? Explain that. Where's the transition?"
[Joe Rogan]: Donald Trump! That's it.
"[INPUT]: All I'm saying is, it's -- I don't see it in the numbers. I don't see it actually happening."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: The question is, how quickly can you retrain people? So it's an education problem. The problem with UBI -- there's a couple of problems with UBI. One is, you're creating a straight -- you creating a slippery slide transfer straight into socialism, right? The moment people can start voting themselves money, combine with a democracy."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: It's just a matter of time before the bottom 51 votes themselves. Everything the top 40 line.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And it just -- By the slippery slope, fallacy is not a farce. I know people like saying that, but they haven't thought it through. But the moment you start having a direct transfer mechanism like that in a democracy, you're basically doing it with capitalism which is the engine of economic growth. You're also forcing the entrepreneurs out or telling them not to come here. The estimate I saw for 15 K, your basic income for everybody would be three quarters of current GDP. And of course GDP would shrink in response as all the entrepreneurs fled. So you would essentially bankrupt the country. Another issue with UBI is that, people who are down on their luck, they're not looking for handouts. It's not just about money. It's also about status. It's about meaning. And the moment I start giving money to you and put you on the dole, I've lowered your status, I've made you a second class citizen. So I have to give you meaning. And meaning comes through education and capability. You have to teach a man to fish, not to basically throw your rotting leftover carcasses at him and say, Here, eat the scraps. So it doesn't solve the meaning problem. And lastly it's nonsense to hand 15 K out to everybody, you want to means test people. There's no reason to give it to you and me. So you end up back towards the welfare system where you do have to figure out who needs it and who doesn't. So I think the better route is that we actually establish a set of basic substance services that you have to have and we provide those in abundance to technology based automation. So get basic housing, get basic food, get basic transportation, get high speed internet access, get a phone in your pocket. Those are the kinds of things you want to give people. And finally, in terms of the rate of automation, I think we can educate people very quickly. One of the myths that we have today is that adults can't be reeducated. We view education as this thing where you go to school, you come out and you're out of college and you're done. No more education. Well, that's wrong. You have all these great online boot camps and coding schools coming up there are ones that even pay you to go there now. You can educate people and mass, and you can educate them into creative professions. People who are talking about AI automating programming -- I've never really written serious code. Coding is thinking, it's automatic structure of thinking. And AI, they can program as well or better than humans is an AI that just took over the world. That's end game. That's the end of the human species. And I can give you arguments why I don't think that's coming either. People who are thinking -- and I know it take the opposite side from some very famous people in this debate, but we're nowhere near close to General A.I. Not in our lifetimes. You don't have to worry about it."
[Joe Rogan]: Even in our lifetimes? Really?
"[INPUT]: It's so overblown. It's another -- it's a combination of Cassandra complex. You know, it's fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a God complex, like people who have lost religion so they're looking for meaning in some kind of end of history."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right.
"[INPUT]: The reason why I don't think AI is coming anytime soon is because a lot of the advances in so-called AI today are what we call narrow AI They're really at pattern recognition machine learning to figure out, like what is that object on the screen or how do you find the signal and all of that noise. There is nothing approaching what we call creative thinking. To actually model general intelligence, you run into all kinds of problems. First, we don't know how the brain works at all. Number two, we've never even modeled a paramecium or an amoeba, let alone a human brain. Number three, there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level, at the neuron level, whereas nature is very parsimonious. It uses everything at its disposal. There's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations that is intelligent that isn't accounted for. And the best estimates are would take 50 years of Moore's Law before we can simulate what's going on inside a cell near perfectly, and probably 100 years before we can build a brain that can simulate inside the cells. So putting it at saying that I'm just gonna model neuron is on or off, and then use that to build the human brain is overly simplistic. Furthermore, I would posit there's no such thing as general intelligence. Every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it senses. It evolves in the environment around it. So I think a lot of people who are pedaling general AI the burden of proof is on them. I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching general AI. Instead, we're solving deterministic closed set finite problems using large amounts of data, but it's not sexy to talk about that."
"[Joe Rogan]: If you're talking about mirroring the actual abilities of cells or are you talking about recreating the actual mechanism? Like, what is going on inside cells and biological organisms."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, we just don't know how intelligence works."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. We don't know.
"[INPUT]: We have no idea. So most of the AI approaches basically say we're gonna try and model how the brain works. But they model it at the neuron level which is saying, this neuron's on, that neuron's off."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: They're combining their signal. But I'm saying, the neuron is a cell inside the cell. There's all this machinery going on that's operating the neuron that is also part of the intelligence apparatus. You can't just ignore that an abstract that out. You have to model it down to the inside the cell level."
[Joe Rogan]: It's also part of the biological organism itself.
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: And it has all these needs that, you know, the biological organism has to have food and rest."
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: There's a balance going on. But when you eliminate all that, when there is none of that, and it's just calculations, and we get to a point where it's just this thing that we've created whether we call a computer, but it doesn't have to be a moving thing even a thing that you've created that stores virtually all the information that's available in the world, stores all of the patterns, of all the thinking, of all the great people that have ever lived, all the writers, all the people that have ever published anything, all the people that have ever spoken any words. Stores all of their points, all of their counterpoints, all their contradictions, applies logic and reason and some sort of sense of the future, and starts improving upon these patterns, and then starts acting on its own, based on the information that's been provided with."
"[INPUT]: Well, first you would have to actually simulate a structure of the human brain that can hold all that information. You're basically done with tens of thousands of brains worth of information."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: We can't even build one brain in the next decade or two or three.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, in terms of an actual physical brain, yes, but what about something that recreates the abilities of a brain?"
"[INPUT]: Like I said, nature is parsimonious. So we've got this three pound [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Right."
"[INPUT]: They wouldn't evolve properly. So I think just dumping information into into a thing isn't enough. It has to have an environment to operate in, to get feedback from. It needs to have context."
"[Joe Rogan]: But isn't that biological? I mean, if you have just the -- all the information that people have accumulated and the lessons that people have learned, and you program that into the computer. Like, if we can take a computer that can beat someone at chess, the real question was, well, can we make it some sort of an artificial intelligence could beat someone at Go? Which is far more complex a chess. They figured out how to do that too. And that was a giant shock, right?"
[INPUT]: These are still man made very closed bounded games. They're not on the road to the unbounded game of life. They are completely artificial.
"[Joe Rogan]: But this -- didn't Go, didn't that give you like a little bit of a pause?"
"[INPUT]: A little bit. Go is not -- Go or League of Legends or Fortnite, they're not completely deterministic."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: But they're still very artificial or very bounded games. Being good at Go doesn't mean that you can then suddenly figure out how to write great poetry.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. The creativity for sure is something that's afraid.
"[INPUT]: A creativity is the last frontier. So I do believe that automation, over a long enough period of time, will replace every non-creative job or every non-creative work. But that's great news. That means that all of our basic needs are taken care of. And what remains for us is to be creative, which is really what every human wants."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I mean, what are you doing right now?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: This is the creative job.
"[Joe Rogan]: Sure. That brings us back to the idea of meaning and universal basic income. I think the idea of giving someone $15,000 a year doesn't necessarily cause whatever one would worry about is people being on the dole. You would have a bunch of listless people out there with no meaning in life. But the idea is that $15,000 a year, and I'm not necessarily sure I agree with this, I'm not even endorsing this. But that $15,000 a year would just provide you with the necessities to get by in life. It would give you food. It would give you shelter."
"[INPUT]: Well, it's not gonna stop at 15, because the moment people are like -- I mean, 15 like --"
[Joe Rogan]: People gonna demand more.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Brad Sanders would be on the --
"[INPUT]: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 --"
"[Joe Rogan]: I want $45,000 a year. These companies are too big. Yeah, that could happen."
[INPUT]: It doesn't stop. It just goes all the way to bankruptcy.
[Joe Rogan]: The concern is the slide to socialism.
[INPUT]: It's obvious.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I mean, heck if I was on -- if I was not working and I was getting my 15, I would happily vote for the guy who would give me 20 or 25. It's just common sense. We'd be stupid not to."
[Joe Rogan]: What do you say to the people that don't believe that there is such a thing of ethical as ethical or compassionate capitalism? There's many people today that are espousing Marxism and they're espousing some sort of a socialist society where they believe that capitalism is screwed people over and eliminated the middle class and --
"[INPUT]: There absolute problems with capitalism. I think monopolies are a problem. I think that crony capitalism is a problem, but the government, you know, kind of gets in bed with them and sort of forces things. I think the bankers have really, you know, raped society and the rest of us are suffering for it."
[Joe Rogan]: Literally.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. They've essentially taken huge risks where they privatize the gains and the socialize of losses. So when it fails, they basically get bailed out and bankrupt everybody else. So capitalism has gotten a really bad name. Let's talk about its free exchange, free markets. Free markets and free exchange are intrinsic to humans, from when the first person started a fire and somebody came along with a deer and said, Hey, if I cook my dear on your fire, I'll share some of it with you, right? So specialization of labor, we trade, that's built into the human species. Basic math comes from accounting, keeping track of debts and credits and so on. We need to be able to engage in free trade. The correct criticism of capitalism is when it does not provide equal opportunity. And so we should always strive to provide equal opportunity. But people confuse that with equal outcome. When you have equal outcome, that can only be enforced through violence. Because different people -- free people make different choices. And when they make different choices, they have different outcomes. If you don't let them suffer the consequences of bad choices or reap the rewards from good choices, then you are forcibly redistributing through violence. It's interesting that there isn't -- that there are no socialist -- working socialist examples that exist without violence. You basically need someone to show up with a gun and say, Okay, you're not allowed to do that. You hand this over to that person. So one of the reasons why I do this podcast is because I believe everybody can be wealthy. Everybody. It's not a zero sum game. It is a positive sum game. You create something brand new, you exchange it with me for something brand new I've created, there's higher utility for both of us. The sum of the value created is positive. It's not like status where it's like you're higher up, I'm lower down; you're, president, I must be vice president; you're a plus one, I'm a minus one. It has to cancel zero. We should be all for playing positive some ethical games. The problem is because of these looters who have ruined capitalism's name, but then you get socialists coming in and saying, Burn the whole system down.."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You burn the whole system down, we end up like Venezuela or the former Soviet Union. You don't want to be a failed socialist states with emaciated teens hunting cats in the streets to eat, right? That's literally what happens in some of these places. So I think it is very important not to destroy the engine of progress that brought us here."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, the idea that socialism just hasn't worked yet that it needs to -- we just need to do it right. If we do it right we can -- Have you ever [inaudible 0[INPUT]: Right. 100 million debt and --"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes. Yeah.
[INPUT]: Let's keep trying.
[Joe Rogan]: All over the world. Yeah. And in every single time --
[INPUT]: Absolutely.
[Joe Rogan]: -- it's been implemented. Have you ever had a conversation with someone who is a socialist? Were you --
"[INPUT]: Oh, many times. Some of my better friends are socialist."
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: We really get into it. Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And what does that -- I mean, does anyone have a compelling perspective at all?"
"[INPUT]: I think really socialism comes from the heart, right? We all want to be socialist. Capitalism comes from the head because there are always cheaters in any system."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And there's incentives in a system. So when you're young, if you're not a socialist, you have no heart. When you're older, if you're not a capitalist you have no head, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: You haven't thought it through. So I understand where it comes from. I always liked Nassim Taleb [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: I'm a socialist. That's the right way to live a loving, happy, integrated life."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: But when you're dealing with strangers, I mean, you want to be a real socialist, great. Open all your doors and windows tomorrow."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Please everybody, come take what you want. See how that works out."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. This idea of income inequality, that always strikes me as a very -- it's a deceptive term. Income inequality."
"[INPUT]: Well, let's flip it around. It comes from outcome inequality."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And the outcome inequality is there because you made different choices. Now again, going back, if it was because you didn't have the same opportunities, that's a problem."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: So society should always try to give people equal opportunities. So for example instead of basic income, what if we had a retraining program built into our basic social fabric which said that every four years or every six years or whatever it is, maybe every ten, you can take one year out and we'll pay for you to go retrain completely. And you can go into any profession you like that has some earning power and output, hopefully a creative long term profession, and you can re-educate yourself. That would be much better for society on all levels than basically just saying, No, you're gonna be the dole for the rest of your life."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, you just -- you'd have to lead that horse to water and then make him drink."
[INPUT]: It requires people --
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: -- to put in some effort.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Right? You know, we can't all just sit around. It's just not [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Well, that's my perspective on income inequality. There's always effort in equality. And thought in equality."
[INPUT]: Exactly.
"[Joe Rogan]: There's just some people that are obsessed. And if those people become successful, it doesn't mean they stole from you. It just means that they put in the amount of energy and effort that it's required to reach where they're at."
"[INPUT]: And there's a lot of virtue signalling that goes on now where people say, Well, it's because you're privileged."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, what's all that?"
[INPUT]: You know what the greatest privilege is? You're alive. 85% of humanity is dead.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So, how privileged are you? Then you're living in the first world, then you're -- you know, you have four limbs, et cetera. So you can take that argument all the way. It's kind of a nonsense discussion."
"[Joe Rogan]: What's a very weird progressive argument? And as it pertains to race, is always a weird one, right? Because white privilege to me, although you could look at what they're saying on paper like, yes, yeah, I'm sure there's more black people that are harassed by the police. I'm sure there is more black people who are treated suspiciously by shop owners and the like."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: But the problem isn't the people aren't treated poorly. The problem is the people who treat the people poorly. The problem is racism.
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: The problem is not people that didn't ask to be born white or whatever they are, and they don't get harassed. So this idea of white privilege or male privilege or whatever it is, that's not the problem. You're just looking at someone who's not a victim of this particular problem that you're highlighting, but you're not looking at the perpetrators of the problem. You're making people perpetrators by simply existing and having less melanin in their skin or having their ancestors come from [inaudible 0[INPUT]: [Inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: It's a sneaky way of being racist."
[INPUT]: It's a sneaky -- Yeah. Yeah. And then they say you can't be racist. It's not racist because you're white.
[Joe Rogan]: That's right. That is -- that's hilarious. If you can't be racist against white people. That one --
[INPUT]: Right. Right.
[Joe Rogan]: I found --
"[INPUT]: That's a variation of the whole still while I hit your argument. You know, stop struggling while I'm hitting you."
[Joe Rogan]: But it's just so silly. You've just completely changed what racism mean.
[INPUT]: But what's hilarious is mostly the people who are yelling racist are not the minorities.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: What I look in my Twitter or my social media or on my news, it's white on white violence."
[Joe Rogan]: Virtue signal.
[INPUT]: Yeah. It's white on white violence.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: What's mostly going on is it's elitist whites, blue state whites, college educated whites, beating up on high school educated whites, blue collar -- It's a white collar versus blue collar war that's going on. And the rest of us are just kind of watching like, It's kind of interesting."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's also a side effect of the ability to broadcast, right? Like everyone with a Twitter handle has the ability to broadcast. Everyone with a Facebook page has the ability to pontificate and have these long rambling -- these huge statements that people put out when you read them. It's like, How much time did you put in this? What the fu- Do you put that much time in your kids?."
[INPUT]: Or your job or --
[Joe Rogan]: Or your job or your life or your future or planning for your -- you know what? How much do you work out a day?
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, you just these -- some -- I've read some people's Facebook posts, I'm like, This is a preposterous amount of effort that you put into saying virtually nothing.."
[INPUT]: Let's say humans are being creative.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: Let's see an AI do that.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, that's true. It is creative. It's creative in a very odd way, right? Because it's creative and that they're trying to elicit a response from people and they're trying to raise their social value or raise their position on the social totem pole."
[INPUT]: It's signaling. And it's easy signaling because the kind of thing that everybody has to agree with you.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Because nobody wants to be seen as a horrible person.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: And it's very hard to make that nuanced arguments against that and this is just kind of go along.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. But it's also -- it's -- some of it is so cliche that it seems like I know one guy who poses as a woman on Twitter but he does it --
[INPUT]: Just [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: -- obviously.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: What is this, the name Tatyana?"
[INPUT]: McGrath?
[Joe Rogan]: McGrath. Yeah.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Hilarious.
[INPUT]: Used to be [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, is that the same guy?"
[INPUT]: I think so. Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That's hilarious. I did not -- They killed his account.
[INPUT]: I think it's the same one. I'm not 100% sure
[Joe Rogan]: They killed his account for pretending to be trans-racial.
[INPUT]: That's right.
[Joe Rogan]: They didn't --
[INPUT]: Yeah. He basically says all the crazy stuff --
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: -- that people aren't allowed to say. But he says the craziest version.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And kind of just shows how it's okay. It's like, I saw a tweet from recently just said -- or her, that it's not okay to be white."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes. Yes. And a ton people agree. But it's so close to what they say.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It's so close that it's like the most artful form of subtle parody.
"[INPUT]: Because if you replace in half of these things, if you replace the word white with black or Asian."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, my God."
[INPUT]: Watch the lynch mob they send upon you.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Yeah. It's a strange time in that respect that these are so much noise.
"[INPUT]: There's a famous old saying that's, If you want to see who rules over you, see who you're not allowed to criticize."
"[Joe Rogan]: Excellent. Yeah. That is a -- That's so true, right? Yeah. That's so true. I wonder where this is going. I really do. I wonder. Because this is -- It seems like this new found ability to broadcast that we have with, whether you have a YouTube page, whether you have Twitter or whatever you're doing, this new found ability to spread whatever you're trying to say to so many people with very little understanding on the most part from what's known --"
[INPUT]: I think it's actually a great thing overall.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah I do as well.
"[INPUT]: Because now it means that any human can broadcast to any other human on the planet at any time. So for example if, you know, a totalitarian dictator were to come to power and someone was beating up, you know, had fascist beating up an old woman, like, that would get broadcast out instantly. There would be an instant outrage hue and cry rallying. So in that sense, it helps bring attention to the plight of anybody. But right now, we're going through the phase where we have this newfound power to assemble mobs. And people don't know how to deal with that. So it becomes very easy to setup a mob and have it attack somebody."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Take all the context out. Like, even this conversation I'm sure people will take out snippets, put them on social media, and try and get somebody outraged."
[Joe Rogan]: Of course.
"[INPUT]: And so you have to learn how -- First of all, society has to get over this idea of outrage. Like, to me, like outraged people are the s- -- people who get easily outraged are the stupidest people on social media. Those are the people I block instantly. It's just kind of very low level thinking, right? These are the foot soldiers in a mob. Eventually society just has to get over it. We have to understand that these are all snippets being taken out of context. These are doctored video clips. These are just someone who's trying to get outraged over something. Eventually they'll also be anti mob tactics. Like, for example, if I go to someone's Twitter feed, and all it is is full of political ranting, raving, conspiracy theories, do I want to work with this person? Do I want to associate with this person? Do I want to be friends with this person? Their mind is just cluttered with junk. Now, I don't necessarily blame them. I think that the human brain is not designed to absorb all of the worlds breaking news 24/7 emergencies injected straight into your skull with click bait headline news. If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you're well-meaning, even if you're sound of mind and body, it will eventually drive you insane. This goes back to Clockwork Orange where he's, you know, has his eyes opened. He's forced to watch the news. But I think that's what's happening right now, because these are addictive, right? Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, these are weaponized. You have social statisticians and scientists and researchers and people in lab coats, literally. Best minds of our generation figuring out how to addict you to the news."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And if you fall for it, if you get addicted, your brain will get destroyed. And I think this is the modern struggle, right? The modern struggle. So the ancient struggle used to be the tribal struggle. You had your tribe of friends and family, you had your religion, you had your country, you had your loyalty, you had your nationality. At least you had meaning and support. But now, you would struggle against other tribes. Modern life was so free. Everything's become atomized. We stand alone. You'll live in your apartment alone. You live in your house alone. Your parents don't live nearby. Your friends don't live nearby. You don't have any tribal meaning. You don't believe in religion anymore. You don't believe in country anymore. It's fine. You got a lot of freedoms. Fantastic. But, now, when they come to attack you, you're alone and you can't resist. So how do they attack you? It's all well-meaning. I don't fought capitalism, I love capitalism. But, look at how it happened. Social media, they've massaged all the mechanisms to addict you like a skinner pigeon or a rat who's just gonna click, click, click, click, click. Can't put the phone down. The food, they've taken sugar and they've weaponized it. They've put it into all these different forms and varieties that you can't resist eating. Drugs, right? They've taken pharmaceuticals, and plants, and they've synthesized them. They've grown them in such a way that you can't -- you get addicted, you can't put them down. Porn, right? If you're a young male, you wonder on the internet, it'll like sapped away your libido and you're not going out in real life society anymore because you've got this incredibly stimulating stuff coming at you. Video games, another way to addict people. So, you have this -- you have entire large factories of people that are working to addict you to these things and you stand alone. So the modern struggle isn't individuals learning how to resist these things in the first place. Drawing your own boundaries. And there's no one there to help you."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's terrifying. I mean, it is."
[INPUT]: Surprised if you don't.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's a new road that needs to be navigated by young people that are -- there's no map, there's no guidebook on how to handle this."
"[INPUT]: Our generation is the transition generation. I think our kids will know how to handle it better, because they'll grow up with it. I hope. I hope."
"[Joe Rogan]: I hope too. You're seeing some ridiculous behavior from people today. That's so common. I mean, I don't know if you've been paying attention to this, but there was a guy who -- he made a video. It turns out it wasn't even him that made the video at least that's not what he said. But it was a video where he sort of doctored Nancy Pelosi talking, and made it look like she was drunk. And then a bunch of people retweeted it, like, Oh, my God. Look, she's drunk. And so one of the online publications, some website, tracked him down and dox him. And turned out he's just a day laborer who is an African-American Trump fan, and thought it would be funny to do that. And it turns out that he didn't even -- at least according to him, he actually just put it up on his Facebook page. What's even more disturbing is Facebook gave up his information to this website."
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: For what? Because he made something funny that made people seem drunk? There's a million of those about me. I mean, you could find them. I mean --"
"[INPUT]: Well, I think Facebook and Twitter and a bunch of these other social media platforms are committing slow motion suicide through these kinds of activities."
[Joe Rogan]: That was a stunning one though.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That they would give up this guy who is a laborer because he made a parody video or he made someone look foolish with editing.
"[INPUT]: Well, you now have, basically, the media views it as their job to go after individuals they don't like."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, I use media with air quotes in that regard."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: I don't think this is something that the New York Times would have done.
"[INPUT]: No, no."
"[Joe Rogan]: Anything is possible, but --"
"[INPUT]: But the media is getting more and more desperate, right? Because what happened was, before the internet, you could have two local newspapers in every town and you could have two local news stations, you know, TV stations in every town. And then CNN came along and started commodities in the news 24/7 broadcasts. And then the internet came along, that was the final nail in the coffin. Because what the internet did was, it said, actually if there's a fact that's news, you can distribute that immediately. It can go on Twitter, it can go on Facebook, it gets reprinted on Google News a thousand times. You know, you go on Google News, you're like, okay, watch a piece of news, which source and 3000 other articles. Too many, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: So news has become commoditized. So the entire news media has shifted into pedaling opinions and entertainment.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And so, now they've become a variation between like cheerleaders, shock troops enforcers, you know, talking heads. So these are now tribal. Well, these are not propaganda machines signaling for their tribes. It's a right wing one, that's left wing one, right? There's the Alt right, there's a Control left, and the two of them were just fighting it out using their various media organs and memes. So basically when you see one of these news organizations doxing an individual, that's like a tank running over a soldier. Right? That's what's going on. It's just a war. And so, there's no such thing anymore as a neutral media commentator. The illusion of objectivity that journalism had is lost. There's no longer one guy like Walter Cronkite that everyone's gonna listened to."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: It's now just shock troops fighting wars with each other.
[Joe Rogan]: How does this play out? Have you thought about it?
"[INPUT]: Yeah, a little bit. So what the internet does -- A lot of this is internet driven. What the internet does, is the internet creates one giant aggregator or two, for everything. One taxi dispatcher, one e-commerce store, one search engine, one, you know, one social media site for friends and family, one for business, et cetera. So the internet is this giant aggregator where it creates one big [inaudible 0[Joe Rogan]: Right."
"[INPUT]: And I say something horrible to you on the phone, the phone company doesn't get in trouble. But the moment they started taking stuff down that wasn't illegal, because somebody scream, they basically lost their right to be viewed as a carrier. And now all of a sudden, they've taken on liability. So they're sliding down the slippery slope into ruin. Slope into ruin where the left wants them to take down the right, the right wants to take down the left, and now they have no more friends, they have no allies. Traditionally the libertarian leaning Republicans and Democrats would have stood up in principle for the common carriers, but now they won't. So, my guess is as soon as Congress -- this is -- this day is coming, if not already here. It might even have been here today actually, because you saw something related in the news. The day is coming when the politicians realize that these social media platforms are picking the next president, the next Congressman. They are literally picking. And they have the power to pick, so they will be controlled by the government."
[Joe Rogan]: In what way? How do you think they're gonna be controlled? You think they're gonna have to adhere to strict principles of freedom of speech?
"[INPUT]: No, no. Unfortunately --"
[Joe Rogan]: First Amendment?
"[INPUT]: Unfortunately it's headed the opposite direction, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: The opposite --
"[INPUT]: I wish it was freedom of speech. Much more likely they're gonna be -- in the short to medium term, they're gonna be hauled in for hearings. They're gonna be pressured massively, do this, don't do that."
[Joe Rogan]: My concern about that is the hearings that I saw with Zuckerberg. Those people were completely incompetent. They don't seem to understand.
[INPUT]: They don't. They don't. But they're just applying pressure. They're just trying to scare him so he'll do what they want. And --
[Joe Rogan]: What do they want him to do?
"[INPUT]: They want him to basically suppress the other side. So if you're a right wing, you want to suppress the left wing. If you're left wing, you want to suppress the right wing. And if you just see where these companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley, all the sensors, and that's really what they are. There are sensors working inside these companies. They're just called -- they're called by different names, obviously, right? It's doublespeak. You call the Department of Defense when it's the Department of War. So in this case, the Department of Safety and Trust when really it's a Department of Censorship. The sensors are inside Silicon Valley, so it's going to reflect Silicon Valley politics."
[Joe Rogan]: Which is extremely progressive left wing.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: And if you're not that, you really have no place."
[INPUT]: That's right.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, try being a conservative and open conservative at Google. Good luck."
"[INPUT]: No, you get lynched."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, I don't think that there was ever a thing like that, that was so influential and so politically ideologically one sided."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, there's a little saying on the internet, I think it's called Conquest Law, that any organization that's not explicitly left or right wing eventually becomes left wing. And I don't know why that's true but it does seem to me to be true."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well. it's a fascinating battle that's going on right now. I mean, it really is. And conservatives. And as far as social media is concerned, they're just getting chopped off at the hams, left and right."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. What'll eventually happen is that whenever you suppress speech, the organism metastasizes, then it has to start turning towards other means. If you're unlucky, it goes towards violence. If you're lucky, they'll find other outlets. I think what will happen is we will start creating decentralized media that's not owned by any single entity. That can't be suppressed or shut down. That will then start spreading these various things."
[Joe Rogan]: And that will take the place of Twitter or Facebook or what have you.
"[INPUT]: That's right. But it's gonna take 10 years, 20 years."
[Joe Rogan]: At least.
[INPUT]: It's not overnight.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, you know, Twitter took 10 more years to get to the point where it's at this mess right now."
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: But it was so interesting to have Jack Dorsey and to talk to him about where it's going, where he thinks he's gotten his own principles, which he believes that it's a fundamental right, and he believes that freedom of speech is something that we all should have, and that these platforms should essentially be like utilities, like the electric company."
[INPUT]: Jack is correct. And he has the right vision. It's just he's in an organization where the other individuals in the organization feel differently.
[Joe Rogan]: Very differently. Right.
[INPUT]: So the organization itself can get hijacked.
"[Joe Rogan]: And his timeline for changing things, is like, it's decades."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: I mean, I don't -- I shouldn't say decades, but I mean, I was like, when do you think that something --"
[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: There is a part -- There was one idea of having an uncensored Twitter. Like, one Twitter that's the wild west. Like, you can have regular Twitter or you could try Wild West Twitter."
"[INPUT]: Well, that already exists and that were called Gab."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes. But Gap isn't named Wild West Twitter. They -- when people dox people, they remove things like that."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. I mean, I think there's certainly lines around violence and --"
[Joe Rogan]: Threats.
"[INPUT]: -- illegality that you don't want to cross, but --"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: -- Gab is closer to free speech platform, but it's still not decentralized. I can still get shut down."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: I can still get taken out.
[Joe Rogan]: Which also suppressed heavily.
"[INPUT]: Yes. And the people on there are right now extremely right wing. So it's not a pleasant place for someone like me to hang out [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: With all the people that have been kicked off or something else, so --"
[INPUT]: That's right. That's right.
[Joe Rogan]: -- try going over there and being moderate. Try going over there.
[INPUT]: No.
[Joe Rogan]: There's no room for you.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Unfortunately, because I don't identify as any party or any creed --"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: -- you know, it doesn't work for me."
[Joe Rogan]: Is that a problem in Silicon Valley when you don't identify as anything? Do you get pressure?
"[INPUT]: Totally. It used to be okay, it's not okay anymore."
[Joe Rogan]: When was it okay?
"[INPUT]: Like, 10 years ago, I would say it was okay."
[Joe Rogan]: And then you started seeing a shift?
[INPUT]: Yeah. And now you have to pick sides. Otherwise you're automatically the enemy.
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: Yeah. Struggle sessions and all that.
[Joe Rogan]: God. Struggle sessions.
"[INPUT]: I'm exaggerating for effect, but definitely has that oppressive feeling to it."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. And you also have to be politically outspoken.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It can't be something that you just stay neutral about.
"[INPUT]: Right. It's like when Tim Ferriss, I think at some point, put out a tweet about how you can't just say anything anymore and, you know, people are being suppressed. And a whole bunch of people who loved him from Silicon Valley piled in and said, What is it that you can't say? What are you afraid to say? You can say whatever you want to him. Go ahead. What are you afraid of? They're like baiting him."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. What was he trying to say? Well, we have to put him in that box. He was someone who is thinking about saying something he shouldn't have said."
[INPUT]: Exactly.
[Joe Rogan]: Now we know.
"[INPUT]: One great tweet I saw was, you know, The left won the culture wars and other just driving around shooting the survivors."
"[Joe Rogan]: Wow. That's hilarious. Yeah, I wonder. I wonder who has won the culture war. Certainly a battle that's been won in terms of like controlled social media. Controlled social media is absolutely laughable."
"[INPUT]: Well, this is unfortunate for conservatives, but technology is a force that also pushes left. So if you look all throughout human history, like the left it essentially grows and grows and grows, right? Why is that? Why is it inexorably that -- as some commentators have said, Leviathan slouches left, right? Leviathan is the government, why does it slouch left? And I think a lot of that has been because of technology. Technology has made it so that it makes more -- it's like industrial revolution technology. We all band together. We're wards of the state, right? Contraception is a technology that kind of helps lean left where it takes away from the family unit. Abortion is a technology, right? It wasn't possible thousands of years ago. So technology actually empowers the individual. The individual means that you have the breakdown of family structure and religion and all that. And I'm not necessarily opposed to that. But it does mean that there is a leftward shift to it. Now we are getting a small set of technologies that actually can take you more rightward. Encryption is an example, because encryption makes it easier to have privacy. It makes it easier to have money that is outside of the state. Guns. 3D printing of guns is an example of a technology that is more of a rightward shift. But generally, technology leads the world left."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah it's also usually highly educated people that are involved in technology in the first place. And I think when you look at universities in particular, they tend to lean left in this country as well."
"[INPUT]: Well, universities -- What happened to the university is very interesting. Universities first when, you know, became the arbiters of data and intellectualism and know what's right and wrong. So there's a time period when it was like, Should we be doing that or not? Well, let's look at the University, what do they have to say? What are the smartest people, the professors, the think tanks have to say? And the universities got this credibility from the hard sciences. So they got this from, you know, physics and math and computer science and chemistry, because these deliver real things; the Manhattan Project, the microprocessor, the space vehicles and so on, the electric car. So they gain this mantle of authority and legitimacy from the hard sciences. So then, come the social sciences kind of sneak in. Then you get economy -- economics. And microeconomics is a real discipline, real science, real math behind it, logic, reason. And then you get macro economics which can be politicized a little bit more voodoo, and then you get social studies, and then you get gender studies, and then you get blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And so what happened is that because we took scientists to be the high priests of our new world, science itself has gotten corrupted. And the social sciences, and you can tell they're fake sciences because the word science tacked on at the end have come in and hijacked the universities and become the new think tanks. And so, essentially, what you see going on today in the universities is a war between the social sciences and the physical sciences. And the crossover point is biology, right? Where you can see like the whole gender is a social construct movement is attacking biology and evolutionary biology. Just like in the social sphere, they're coming after the comedians, right? But you can see the struggle going on in the universities. And I would say the physical sciences are essentially losing that war."
[Joe Rogan]: What can be done? Or is it just something that has to play out? Is it -- Do we have to realize the consequences of the foolishness?
"[INPUT]: Well, the good news is, the physical sciences have a reality on their side, right?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, but it's not even -- in many ways, it's not respected."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. But at the end of the day, your aircraft still has to fly, you know, your microprocessor still has to compute. So, there's only so far they can take it. But I do see, for example in biology, a lot of biologists are facing this difficult thing where they have to say things that they know are not true to keep their job."
[Joe Rogan]: Like what?
"[INPUT]: Well, you had Brett Weinstein on here."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Right? So, that's a clear example."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So there's just, the crossover line of what is acceptable and what's not is entering into biology. And biology will probably suffer the most. Synthetic biology for example, will -- you know, a lot of this will end up in China, because it won't be -- you won't be able to map facts and reality and actions together, you won't be able to get grants, you won't be able to get the adulation of your peers. I don't know enough here's, so now I'm in shaky territory, but it's just my sense that that crossover battleground right now is an evolutionary biology. Economic's lost."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's certainly in terms of gender and that sort of -- that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And it's also gonna happen, for example, Blank Slate theory. You know, are we nature, are we nurture."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: It's kind of socially unacceptable to say that, you know, a lot of it is nature and not nurture or vice versa, depending on which side you're on."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Those kinds of discussions get corrupted.
"[Joe Rogan]: They do get corrupt. And it's really unfortunate because that's an unbelievably important thing to understand. Like, what makes a person a sociopath? What makes a person a super successful person, a winner?"
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: What makes a person a drug addict? What are these factors?
[INPUT]: You can't have a reasonable conversation about climate science anymore.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: It's not a science, it's all politicized."
[Joe Rogan]: You can't even bring it up.
[INPUT]: Everyone's got their minds made up already.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, it's uncomfortable to me as people have their minds made up and they don't even have the data."
"[INPUT]: On most of these topics, people are talking past each other anyway."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: They're talking about different things. Like, when you get into, you know, when you get into gun control for example. Right? One side is talking about the right to bear arms in case a tyrannical ruler or King drastic over the country. The other side is talking about school shootings and, you know, protecting people in their homes, right? From crime. So they're just talking about two different things."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And it's just not politically acceptable to even talk about the same thing. Or when it gets to immigration, the right is talking about -- you know. The left is like bundling together illegal immigration and legal immigration into one thing."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Right? Whereas on the right, sometimes you've got racists hiding in there. So it doesn't help their cause, right? They're talking about two different things."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: If they were talking about the same thing, which is how many immigrants should we let into the country and, you know, what are the criteria for that. That would be a very different conversation than no immigrants or everybody comes in. And then also on the left, you know, you had this benefit that everybody who's currently coming in illegally is gonna vote for the left because of where they're coming from and their socioeconomic circumstances. To me, the test of any good system is, you build a system, hand it over to your enemies to run for the next decade. So for example, if you want a censorship on Twitter or Facebook, you should build that system, and then hand it over to the other side to run. So if you're a left winger who's promoting censorship, let somebody else running. Same with immigration. If you want immigration system, build the system, then hand it over to the other side to running. That's how you know it's a good system."
"[Joe Rogan]: There's no room for nuance when you're dealing with these political battlegrounds. When you're dealing with right versus left and one side has clearly established stance that you're supposed to take, like gun control is a great example of that, right? There's no room for, what about mental health? What about the fact that so many of these people are on psych medication?"
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: Why is that not being asked?
[INPUT]: We're running one of the greatest mental health experiments in history.
"[Joe Rogan]: The greatest, right?"
[INPUT]: When we're doping everybody up and SSRIs.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. And, you know, maybe if you give 30 million people SSRIs, maybe like 29.9 million are a lot happier. And then you have a fraction that commit suicide or detonate."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Right? You're basically trading the mean for the variance.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: You have blowup risk. Yeah, there's no room for nuance, which is why I stay out of politics, largely."
[Joe Rogan]: Do they drag you in though sometimes?
[INPUT]: They always try.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, even this conversation forces --"
[INPUT]: Even this conversation.
[Joe Rogan]: -- you get -- to get dragged in.
[INPUT]: Sure. But --
[Joe Rogan]: I'm sure there's gonna be some people --
"[INPUT]: Here's the thing about politics. Because there -- we have a first pass the post system. What that means is that whoever wins 51 percent of the vote in this country gets a lot of the power, right? It's not like proportional representation where the Greens have 10% and, you know, libertarians of 3% or whatever it is. Just like you're all Democrat in power, now all Republican. Because of that, to win, you have to pick one of these two sides. Right? You have to choose. You can't just basically say, I'm gonna be, you know nuanced about it. You can't vote for a third party that's throwing away your vote, right? I have a friend who's trying to fix that, he's starting this thing called a good party, where like you kickstart your vote. So you combine all your votes, you hold them in reserve, and then when you have enough to win, then you vote that person in power. Right? So you don't throw your vote. But outside of those hacks, we're never gonna be a third party elected. So because of that, all of your beliefs have to neatly fit into the Democrat bundle or the Republican bundle. And so, when you get into that tribe, if you signal out of that bundle, you get attacked."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: So it's literally -- it's making you into an unclear thinker. It's making you into a model thinker. If all of your beliefs line up into one political party, you're not a clear thinker. If all your beliefs are the same as your neighbors and your friends, you're not a clear thinker. You're literally just -- your beliefs are socialized. They're taken from other people. So if you want to be a clear thinker, you cannot pay attention to politics. It will destroy your ability to think."
[Joe Rogan]: Ugh. That would dread.
"[INPUT]: Most of modern life, all our diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity. Like old times, I may have starved. You know, old times if I got sugar, that was a wonderful thing. I should have eaten all the sugar to get my hands on. If I'd gotten a piece of news or gossip, that was interesting data that would have helped my life and move me forward. If I'd gotten some brief amount of entertainment, whether through video games or magazines or whatever that would've been good. Now, it's all disease of abundance. We are overexposed to everything. So, the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic. It is to retreat from society. There's too much society everywhere you go; society in your phone, society in your pocket, society in your ears. You're being socialized right now by listening to this podcast."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: We're socializing you. We're programming you. Everyone's trying to program everybody. The only solution is turn it off.
[Joe Rogan]: The only solution is to turn it off and concentrate on your breathing.
[INPUT]: Meditation. Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yes. I mean, that's huge."
[INPUT]: It works. It's been a lifesaver for me.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, I do it. And I do it whenever I get like spare time. I was at the doctor's office this morning and I knew I was gonna be 20 minutes, so I just sat there with my eyes closed for 20 minutes and I melted."
"[INPUT]: You know, when I was growing up, there was this statement, I think it was Pascal, he said, you know, All of man's problems arise because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone. And it's very true. I always needed to be stimulated. And when the iPhone came along, bored and was dead."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: I would never this bored again. If I'm standing in line, I'm on my iPhone, and I thought it was great. And when I was a kid I used to try and overclock my brain like, How many thoughts can I think at once? The answer is only one, but I would try to like think multiple thoughts at once."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And I was proud of that. I was proud that my brain was always running, this engine was always moving. And it's a disease. It's actually the road to misery. And now that I'm older, I realize that you actually want to, again, rest your mind, you want to learn how to settle into your mind. Now, I look forward to solitary confinement. You'll leave me alone for a day. It'll be like the happiest day I've had in a while. And that is a superpower that I think everybody can attain."
[Joe Rogan]: The superpower of learning to be alone and enjoying it.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Well, I think it's critical. And I do think that these times where you just think about things, just be alone and think about things are so rare these days. And I think during those rare times is when you really get to understand what you actually believe or don't believe."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's funny. When I first started meditating, it was really hard, right? Because everybody -- I think a lot of people who listen to this broadcast have heard of meditation that has a good reps. Everybody tries it, they struggle, they kind of give it up. It's one of those things that everybody says they do, but nobody actually does. Right? It's like not eating sugar, right? Everyone talks about how, Yeah, I don't eat sugar."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Then the dessert tray rolls around and everyone's going for the cookies.
[Joe Rogan]: Yep.
[INPUT]: Right?
[Joe Rogan]: Yep.
"[INPUT]: So, it's become one of those things. And in fact it's now even become a signaling thing where it's like, Oh, how much did you meditate?."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: I meditate this much.
[Joe Rogan]: Yep.
"[INPUT]: You know, there are people now wearing headbands saying -- with Tweety Bird that chirping there when they're in deep meditation. I don't know how they make it work, but they'd be like, I've got a lot of chirps today. How many chirps did you get? Right?"
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, God."
"[INPUT]: Oh, your meditation technique is wrong, mine is right. But really, all it is is the art of doing nothing. Okay? And it's important because I think when we grow up, right? All this stuff happening to you in your life. And some of it you're processing, some of it you're absorbing, and some of it you should probably think a little bit more about and work through, but you don't, you don't have time. So it gets buried in you. It's all these preferences and judgments and unresolved situations and issues. And it's like your e-mail inbox. It's just piling up, e-mail after e-mail after e-mail that's not answered, going back 10, 20, 30, 40 years. And then when you sit down to meditate, those e-mails start coming back at you. Hey, what about this issue? What about that issue? Have you solved this? Do you think about that? You have regrets there? You have issues there? And that gets scary. People don't want to do that. Like, It's not working. I can't clear my mind. I better get up and not do this. But really what's happening is it's self therapy. It's just that, instead of paying a therapist to sit there and listen to you, you're listening to yourself. And you just have to sit there as those e-mails go through one by one, you work through each of them until you get to the magical inbox zero. And there comes a day when you sit down, you realize the only things you're thinking about are the things that happened yesterday, because you've processed everything else. Not necessarily even resolved it, but at least listen to yourself, and that's when meditation starts. And I think it's a very powerful thing that everybody should experience and that's when you arrive upon the art of doing nothing."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, I think it's even a problem that most people are getting their meditation from an app."
[INPUT]: I will not use an app.
"[Joe Rogan]: It's sneaky. I mean, Sam Harris is a very good meditation, I'll [inaudible 1[INPUT]: It is literally the art of doing nothing."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: So, all you need to do for meditation is just sit down, close your eyes, comfortable position, whatever happens happens. If you think, you think; if you don't think, you don't think. Don't put effort into it, don't put effort against it, it's all you need."
[Joe Rogan]: Do you concentrate on your breath?
[INPUT]: Nothing.
[Joe Rogan]: Or do you have a specific technique?
[INPUT]: Nothing.
[Joe Rogan]: Nothing?
[INPUT]: Nothing. No. You just --
[Joe Rogan]: You just sit.
[INPUT]: You just sit.
"[Joe Rogan]: I think about my breath. That's all I do, I just --"
[INPUT]: You can do that.
[Joe Rogan]: I try to only concentrate on breathing.
"[INPUT]: I used to do that, but at some level, all the concentration -- Every meditation technique is leading you to the same thing which is just witnessing."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: And concentration is a technique to steal your mind enough that you can then drop the object of concentration. So you could also just try going straight to the end game. The problem with what I'm talking about, which is not focusing on your breath is you will have to listen to your mind for a long time. It's not gonna work unless you do at least an hour a day, and preferably at least 60 days before you've kind of worked through a lot of issues. So it'll be hell for a while, but when you come out the other side, it's great."
[Joe Rogan]: You get rid of the chatter.
"[INPUT]: Or when the chatter comes, it's in the background, it's dimmer, it's smaller, you've heard it before, you see the patterns. It's more recent. It's something you need to resolve anyway. And you will get moments of actual silence."
"[Joe Rogan]: What is your -- what's your ultimate state when you meditate? Like, is there a state where you've achieved, rarely, if ever, where you just -- you're in bliss or you're in harmony or you're in enlightenment? Like, what --"
"[INPUT]: It's kind of indescribable, because when you're really meditating, you're not there. When there's no thoughts, there's no experience through, there's nothing."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: There's just nothing. So it's it's hard to describe. But I would say that it's like a -- you could definitely -- every psychedelic state that people encounter using so-called plant medicines can be arrived at just through pure meditation. And I've definitely hit some of those states.
[Joe Rogan]: You've hit some transcendent psychedelic states where you're --
"[INPUT]: Yeah, I've had --"
"[Joe Rogan]: -- halucinating, the whole deal?"
"[INPUT]: I've had trippy visuals, I've had the kind of lights and colors, I've had the so-called downloads, I've had the realizations, I've had the bliss I've had the light, I've had the colors, but --"
[Joe Rogan]: But not every time?
"[INPUT]: No, it's rarely. And in fact, I would say that's also like an experience that you can start craving which will then actually take you out of meditation, where you really -- and I'm not enlightened or anything close to it, so not even in the ballpark. But my own experience and this is this personal experience, is the place where I end up the most, that is really the one that I want to be at, is peace. It's just peace."
[Joe Rogan]: Peace. Happy.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, peace -- To me, peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is kind of peace in motion. You can convert peace to happiness anytime you want, but peace is what you want most of the time."
[Joe Rogan]: That's interesting. You can convert peace to happiness anytime you want.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. If you're a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity. And by the way, being on social media, engaging in politics, will not bring your peace."
[Joe Rogan]: There is nothing less peaceful.
[INPUT]: Right. And the w-
[Joe Rogan]: In today's day and age?
[INPUT]: The way we think you get peace is by resolving all your external problems. But there is unlimited external problems. So the only way to actually get pieces on the inside by giving up this idea of problems.
[Joe Rogan]: Who thinks you can get peace by resolving external problems other than politicians?
[INPUT]: Everybody.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah?
"[INPUT]: That's what everybody struggling to do, right? Why are you trying to make money? To solve all your money problems. Why try to win at politics? Because then you'll be at peace because your people will have won.."
[Joe Rogan]: It's a daunting task to get your shit together.
[INPUT]: It's easier to change yourself than to change the world.
[Joe Rogan]: That's true.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And the best way to change the world is to change yourself.
"[INPUT]: Exactly. It's -- all these people who are shouting on social media, the best way is just to actually live the life that you want other people to live. Like, I went to New Zealand, and there's this guy that I met with, and -- you know everyone's on social media shouting about environmentalism and conserve and sustain. And I go to this guy's house, and he was doing a very quietly, very gently, he was doing a two week long zero waste experiment, where he was throwing out nothing. So every package that he opened he would keep and he would like clean it up, so he would keep his Amazon boxes, he keep the little contain- even tea bag. If he opened the tea bag, he has to figure out how to compost the tea inside, how to make the tea itself useful, how to make the tea bag like a little storage item. So there was no trash. He was literally living with zero trash waste, and he was doing it. And it was really inspirational. Meeting people like him made me far more environmentally conscious than, you know, any amount of people yelling at me on social media ever will."
[Joe Rogan]: How long did he do that for?
[INPUT]: I think it was two weeks. It was hard.
[Joe Rogan]: What the fuck are you gonna do with tea bags?
[INPUT]: He had quite the collection.
[Joe Rogan]: The tea bags.
[INPUT]: He wasn't filling them with little things.
[Joe Rogan]: It sounds like you're a crazy hoarder.
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Like a hoarder person with stacks of tea bags in his house.
[INPUT]: Very impressive guy.
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah, that's a strange way to go about things. I appreciate it. I mean, look, it is entirely possible to somehow or another engineer all of our cups and all of our things and all about to be biodegradable."
"[INPUT]: You know, the struggle with the modern environmental movement is that they identify the correct problem which is finite earth spaceship. Earth is all we got, don't ruin it. But they don't have the solution. So what they say is no growth, no growth, no growth. The problem is you got 3 billion Indian and Chinese who aren't going to stay in poverty."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: They're gonna roll whether you like it or not. So you can yell at them, you can scream at them, you can yell at us and scream at us, but that's not gonna happen. So the only way out, unfortunately is, again, through technology, which is you have to build green technology. And I give Musk a lot of credit, you know, for being one of the few people who's out there trying to do that. So you build things that are biodegradable and good for you and healthier. And everybody wants to be healthier; Chinese want to be healthier, Indians want to be healthier. They want to be cleaner. If you say, I can clean up your rivers, I can clean up your forests, I can have your children not get sick with cholera and diphtheria and typhoid, I can cure your diseases, I can help make your immune system stronger, I can give you clean drinking water. Like, that is what causes people to become environmentalists. Not shouting and screaming at them that they shouldn't grow and they should stop pumping things into the sky. You know, they have no concept of that. They're just trying to get out of poverty. So, I think the modern environmental movement identifies the correct problem, but then doesn't come up with the right set of solutions that are appealing to people. People are not going to give up economic growth. They're gonna have to get rich first."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's -- Yeah, that's a very good point. But how do do you do both?"
[INPUT]: You lower the price of clean technologies massively. So you basically make clean technologies cost competitive --
[Joe Rogan]: Through subsidy? Through --
[INPUT]: -- [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Or they freely give away their patents. That's the example of how you can do it. So, you know, someone -- if you wanna get rid of plastics such straws, yeah, you can do it here and there, you can get San Francisco to ban plastic straws. But China's not gonna ban plastic straws. Not until you build a paper straw that is, you know, same cost, good durability. And then you educate the Chinese like, Hey, this is petroleum. You know this plastic that you're doing is petroleum. This is bad for you. Here is the chemical composition. Here's the things that are going into the bloodstream. And they want healthy, happy kids also. So they're gonna have their kids use paper straws. Maybe straws aren't the best example, but you can -- you know, this is true with fossil fuels for example. That's probably the best one. Or replacing a lot of plastics with glass and paper and so on."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah there's a new technology that was just -- Rhonda Patrick [inaudible 1[INPUT]: Right.
"[Joe Rogan]: So then, in that way, plastic waste will become valuable."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: It will become a commodity and it becomes something that people are resource.
"[INPUT]: Now, there are certain problems this doesn't solve; this doesn't solve carbon, this doesn't solve --"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: -- deforestation, you know. So there, you kind of have to step in with other means. So for example, look at the Amazon, right? Everyone's complaining about the Amazon being deforested. Well, you're not the poor Brazilian farmer."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. Right.
"[INPUT]: So you're sitting here in your comfortable chair, like social media hammering away at, you know, the evil Brazilians with deforesting the Amazon. But the Amazon has incredible resources. If we really care about it, we should turn it into an incredible tourist park and put your money where your mouth is, start doing eco-tourism in the Amazon, start paying for it. And then maybe take the future rights for all the pharmaceuticals that come out of all the incredible plants there and start selling those off, so that people -- so that maybe give the pharmaceutical companies an incentive to preserve the biodiversity the Amazon, say, Hey, if you buy this patch of the Amazon, you conservative, and you conserve it. Whatever plant medicines that come out of there that you can then license, you get the patent for 20 years or 30 years or whatever. So I think there are solutions where we as the first world, those who have money, can put our money where our mouth is and go and rescue these kinds of properties."
[Joe Rogan]: That's a very interesting solution. But I could see immediate pushback from people that don't think the pharmaceutical companies should have the rights to this natural plant.
[INPUT]: Okay. Or the government does it. And then the government gets the patents and the government will auction off the patents later or --
[Joe Rogan]: That's even worse.
[INPUT]: -- or they'll license them --
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: -- or whatever it is. Right?
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, that's -- the often -- like, just this. The often the problem is there is no really good solution. There's a bunch of solutions that also have drawbacks."
[INPUT]: That's life.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Right?
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: That's the tradeoff, so."
[Joe Rogan]: As being a human.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: It's very messy.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. It's a constrained environment. So obviously I skew more towards a private property capitalist type solutions, because even though they're not perfect, they have been proven to actually work. Right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Once something is your property, you take care of it."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: You're not going to crap all over your own house. But it should probably be temporary property, not permanent property. You see a lot of countries around the world now doing this no foreign ownership of land thing, for example, where Mexico has no private ownership of beaches. Right? So you can draw the line at certain points."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. Do you enjoy doing this kind of thing. We break things down and give your perspective on things and try to illuminate certain complex subjects?
"[INPUT]: I'm not trying to illuminate so much as -- you know, talking to you, I learn as much as I say. And I learn it from myself because I'm being forced to articulate it, right? I can sit around and think my thoughts all day long, but a lot of it's gonna be nonsense. It's not -- I'm gonna -- 'cause there are gaps in thinking where you make leaps, because you're kind to yourself that you don't realize you're making. But when you're forced to write it down, and this is why I tweet, or when you have to talk to somebody, you have to complete those gaps and make it a proper logical chain. And the mistake that I made when I was young was, you know, I always wanted to seem like the smartest kid in the room, you know, like, just like you probably want to seem like the funniest kid in the room or the toughest kid in the room, right? We're all losers starting out. We want to be winners. So we pick the thing we're good at and we double down on it. So I was one of the smartest kid in the room. So what did I do? I read a lot of books. I memorize a lot of things. And then whatever I hadn't memorized -- this is pre-Google -- I made it up [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: Right."
"[INPUT]: And I had to get better, right? So Google improved me that way."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. A lot of people.
"[INPUT]: Exactly. So, now what I realized is that the biggest mistake was memorization. Right? Because when you're actually trying to live your life in congruence with reality, you want to have a deep understanding what you do and why you do it. And so it's much more important to know the basics really well there is to know the advanced. Knowing calculus wouldn't help you today, doesn't help you in business, doesn't help you in most things. But knowing arithmetic really well will help you, really, whether it's at the corner grocery store counting change, to figuring out the value of your podcast business, to figuring out how to do the probability math on, you know, some action that you want to take. So understanding basic mathematics cold is way more important than memorizing calculus concepts. And the problem is -- and this is true of, I think, all reasoning, it's much better to know the basics from the ground up solid foundation of understanding, a steel frame of understanding, than it is to just have a scaffolding, we're just memorizing advanced concepts. This is why that a lot of people I'm sure that you listen to who are really smart, they use a lot of jargon and you can't quite follow their reasoning. You don't know how they're putting things together and you -- this deep down suspicion, They don't even really understand. Right? So if you look at the most powerful thinkers especially the ones where money or life is on the line, they have to understand the basics really, really well. Richard Feynman, the famous physicist was able to -- he had this piece in one of his lectures where he takes you from counting numbers on your hand, all the way to calculus in four pages of text aurally but written down to four pages of text. And it's a complete unbroken logical chain that takes you through geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, analytic geometry, graphs, everything, all the way to calculus. He understood numbers at a core level. He didn't have to memorize anything. When you're memorizing, it's an indication that you don't understand. You should be able to re-derive anything on the spot. And if you can't, you don't know it."
[Joe Rogan]: So do you apply that to things other than mathematics? You applied it to --
[INPUT]: Everything.
[Joe Rogan]: Everything.
[INPUT]: Everything. Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: You don't even make attempt to memorize things. Just make attempt to understand them.
[INPUT]: You can't help but memorize things.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: But if you can't -- And this is where Twitter is great for me, is I try to understand something. And then I try to write it down in such a way that I can remember it, just the basic hook that will point towards the deeper understanding. And I'm forced to explain it to people. And that's how I know I understand something. So this is what I meant originally we talked about reading, a good book I'll read one page in a night, and then I'll spend the rest of night thinking about it, or I'm chasing down references in Wikipedia or weird blog posts trying to understand it. You know. So for example, there was a -- I was dealing with -- this is a few months back, I was dealing with a question of -- stupid topic but -- the meaning of life, right? What's the meaning --"
[Joe Rogan]: How could that be stupid though?
"[INPUT]: Well, it's trite. It's trite. You're not supposed to think about it. It's something you ask your parents when you're young."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: They tell you, Don't worry about it, or they say it's --"
"[Joe Rogan]: Go get the job, hippie."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, exactly. Get a job, you friggin' hippie, or Here is God. God is the meaning of life, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And so I was just trying to resolve for myself, like, What could the answer be? Right? Not, What is the answer? But, What could the answer be? And so, at a core level, I was forced to kind of hunting down all these weird little things and really understand for myself. And it's got to be personal, right? But I've established, for myself, what it could and could not be. And that gave me some level of peace. So now I have to keep asking that question."
[Joe Rogan]: What is the meaning of life?
"[INPUT]: I mean, you -- I think the question is more interesting than the answer. Everyone should explore this on their own. But let me just explore a few parts with you, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
"[INPUT]: So first is, if I gave you an answer, if I said, The meaning of life is to please God. Well, which God? Okay. Judeo-Christian God. Well, okay. Why that one? Why this thing? The problem is it's a why question. You can keep asking why forever, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Any answer I give you, you will just ask why again, why again. Why again."
[Joe Rogan]: Right. We're little kids.
[INPUT]: That's right. And you end up in a place called [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: What is the meaning of life?
"[INPUT]: Yeah. You get to make up your own answer is the beauty. If there was a single answer, we would not be free. We would be trapped. Because then we would all have to live to that answer. Then we'd be Borg like robots. Each one competing with each other to fulfill that single meaning more than the others. Back to signaling, like I'm better at it than you are. But luckily there is no answer, so you just do whatever you want."
"[Joe Rogan]: The meaning of life. It's funny that that was the basis of all existential angst, that you don't --"
[INPUT]: You don't know why you're here.
"[Joe Rogan]: And you have this feeling that it could be meaning less. It is -- I mean, if you -- when you start pondering the multiverse, the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planet, the organism, the cells inside the organism, the bacteria, the parasites, the symbiotic relationship we have to our environment, and you start going, Jesus Christ, what -- am I just a little piece of this thing? It's like --"
"[INPUT]: Well, the answers to all the great questions are paradoxes."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: So for example, you're asking like, Do I matter? That's like really the question you asked, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Well, How do I matter in this infinite universe? Well, you know, on the one hand, you're separate. No two points are the same, every point is -- every two points are infinitely different. You're completely separated. No one will have your thoughts, your emotions, your feelings, your experience, so your life as a single player game. You're trapped inside your head and you're just aware of a bunch of things going on and that's it. On the other hand, I cannot say the word Joe Rogan without invoking the entire universe. Joe Rog- alien comes along says, What's that? Joe Rogan. What's Joe Rogan? That's a human. What's a human? Bipedal ape. What's an ape? On the earth. What's the earth? Planet. What's a planet? Solar system. Where was the carbon made? Inside stars. Right? It's like, I have to create the entire universe to just say the words Joe Rogan. So in that sense, you're connected to everything. It's inseparable. So the answer to that question of, Do I matter? Is, I am nothing and I am everything. And you'll find this with all the great questions. The answers are all paradoxes, which is why at some level, it's sort of pointless to pursue them, to find a trite answer like I'm giving. But the act of pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life that brings a level of peace."
"[Joe Rogan]: I feel like there's -- with many people, this stress of this question is also accentuated by unhappy lives. It's accentuated by unhappy choices, by being trapped. There's a big difference between not knowing what the meaning of life is and, God, I've got gotta get the fuck out of this job. I have to. I can't live my life this way. What's the meaning of lifei if this is my life?."
"[INPUT]: Which is why I always start with, Let's get you rich first. That's why I'm very practical about it. Because, look. You know, Buddha was a prince. Okay? He started out really rich, and then he got to go off in the woods. And in the old days, what happened was, if you wanted to be peaceful inside, you would become a monk. You would renounce everything. You'd become an ascetic. You would give everything up."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: You'd renounce women, men. You'd renounce children. You'd renounce money. You'd renounce politics, science, technology, everything. And you would go out in the woods by yourself. You had to give everything up to be free inside. Well, today, we have this wonderful invention called money where you can just store stuff up in a bank account. Okay? And you can basically save -- You can work really hard. You can do great things for society and society will give you money for giving it things that it wants and it doesn't know how to get. And then you can save that up. And you can live well below what your means and you can find a certain freedom in that, and that will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness. So I believe the solution to making everybody happy is to give them what they want. Let's get them all rich. Well, let's get them all fit and healthy, and then let's get them all happy."
[Joe Rogan]: Is -- Are those things even possible? Can ev-
[INPUT]: Absolutely.
[Joe Rogan]: Everyone can be rich?
[INPUT]: Everyone can be rich.
[Joe Rogan]: Everyone.
[INPUT]: Here's my thought exercise for you.
[Joe Rogan]: Now it seems like we're in an infomercial. Everyone can be rich.
[INPUT]: I'm not selling any --
[Joe Rogan]: Look at my home. This is my Rolls Royce.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. So, that's a good point."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So everything that I've ever created on this topic of how to make money, I will never charge a dollar for. Because that would ruin it. That would show that I'm just another huckster --"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: -- who's ready to get rich off of you. There are no get rich quick. That's just somebody else trying to get rich off of you, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So it's -- So to me, it's more of a philosophical contribution where -- for it to have meaning, and to be legit. I can't charge you anything for it. But yes, everybody can be rich. And let me give you a thought exercise. Okay? Imagine if tomorrow, we could wave a wand and everybody was trained as a scientist or an engineer. Everybody. Even if you weren't very good, you had enough understanding computers, you could write some code, you could build some hardware. And don't tell me people can't do it, because they can. That's just the [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: Is this a scale issue though? I mean, you're talking about it as if this would work with 300 million people."
[INPUT]: It'll work with 10 billion people. It'll work --
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
"[INPUT]: -- with space-faring race with 100 trillion people, just [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: We have the resources. We have the ability."
"[INPUT]: The universe has infinite resources. You build it. You know, have you heard of a Dyson sphere?"
[Joe Rogan]: Mm-hmm.
"[INPUT]: You know, you pull the Dyson sphere on a star and you gather all its energy, like that. There's so much energy out there. One asteroid's got all the minerals that we need. One sun, one solar system has got all the power we would need for a long, long time. You know, we can extract it of nuclear fusion, you know. We're not that far from those kinds of technologies working. It's just a question of guts and, you know, and interests. Like, we should be building Nuclear Fusion test plants on the moon. The moon should be littered with [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: Right. Yeah. How would that work?"
"[INPUT]: Well, it --"
[Joe Rogan]: Does it send a bunch of people up there to work?
[INPUT]: The problem -- Robots.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: The problem with fission -- nuclear fission is that, you know, nature creates energy through nuclear energy. Right? Like, the sun creates energy. Nuclear energy. Now for transmission, we use photons because photons don't interact. And so photons are great for information transmission, but they're actually not great for energy transmission. For energy creation, you want nuclear to work. And the problem is, because nuclear energy, you know, we built it with a bomb, we have dirty nukes, all those kinds of problems at Fukushima. Three Mile Island Chernobyl. We don't innovate anymore on nukes. Imagine if when the first steam engine blew up we said, Oh, no more steam engines for a while."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Very carefully regulated. Billion dollars of regulation. You can't innovate that way. When the first airplane crashed, we said, No more innovation in airplanes. Right? So we need a way to iterate on nuclear fission, and eventually fusion, and get them working, safely, cleanly, passive failure, et cetera. If we're gonna find our way out of the energy trap. And the best place to do that is someplace like on the moon or Mars."
"[Joe Rogan]: Do you think that it's actually a possibility that they could get nuclear power to the point where it's not a detriment? Because what everyone's worried about is a meltdown, right?"
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: And we do have these old plants that are running on this.
[INPUT]: This is 50 year old technology.
[Joe Rogan]: It's crazy.
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: Because there's no ability to shut them off.
"[INPUT]: Right. And very old technology. They do now have Gen IV nuclear reactors that are passive failsafe. So in other words, when they fail, they fail into a s- we need to pull the plug on them. They fell into a state where there's no leakage. There's no problem."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Their default is a positive outcome as opposed to the current ones, the old ones, where if you unplug them, like, everything melt down."
"[Joe Rogan]: And these -- even these Gen IV are just Gen IV. They're not Gen V, Gen VI --"
[INPUT]: They're not Gen 80.
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: Gen 100.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: We are microprocessors, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: And that should be something that people are working towards.
"[INPUT]: I hope so. I mean, in an ideal world, we would -- The problem is, if you have nuclear energy on the moon, how do you get it home. Right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So what you actually got to do is you've got a rabbit on the moon, and you're using it there maybe to launch more satellites, more rockets, further out into the solar system. And that's the initial use case. But then eventually, the technology gets so good you can bring it home."
"[Joe Rogan]: Now I want to go back to this idea of getting people rich, that somehow or another, that's gonna make people happy. How do you stop the natural progression that people have of, you know, Oh, you know, I have got a nice Chevrolet."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: But I really want a BMW. I've got a nice BMW, but now I want a Mercedes. I have Merce- I want a Ferrari."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: How do you stop that material --
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: -- possession trap because --
"[INPUT]: You can't at some level. But I think most smart people over time realize that possession is don't make them happy. Right? It's just, you have to go through that. You have to buy your stupid car to realize that it doesn't attract girls, it actually attracts other dudes who are like, Hey. I like that car, man."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Like, you have some expensive cars out there, some fancy cars. Tell me how, you know, how much that attracts women versus men."
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, I'm married. Those are for me. I just enjoy machines."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: So for me they're toys.
"[INPUT]: That's a particular thing we enjoy machines. But I think very -- as you get older, you just realize that there is no happiness in material possessions. Now, lack of material possessions can make you very unhappy."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: So being poor can make you unhappy, but being rich is not gonna make you happy. And what happens, unfortunately, a lot of people struggle through their whole lives to make money. They make some. They're exhausted. And then they're like, Well, now, why am I not happy? I guess I'm just not a happy person and smart people aren't happy. That's like got a great little way -- People feel better about it, they say, Well, if you're smart, you're not happy. Right?"
[Joe Rogan]: That's right.
"[INPUT]: Whereas I positive the other way. If you're smart, you should be able to figure out how to be happy, otherwise you're not that smart."
"[Joe Rogan]: Yeah that is an offensive statement, that if you're smart, you're not happy. I've heard that before and I just do not understand the logic of that other than self-justifying."
[INPUT]: I understand where it comes from.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It comes from, if you're smart, it's usually because you thought things through and you have very busy mind."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And so, busy mind can often rob you of peace of mind."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: Because when the peace that we seek is not peace of mind, it's peace from mind. Right? And so if you look at all the crazy activities you do to be happy. All right? Whether it's like trying to get laid and have an orgasm or, you know, extreme sports or looking at something beautiful or taking a psychedelic, you're trying to get out of your own mind. You're trying to get your monkey mind to stop chattering at you for a moment. You're trying to get peace from the mind. And there are other better ways to do that. Most of the ways we try to get peace from mind are indirect, whereas if you understand things if you see things properly you will naturally slowly develop peace from mind. Sorry if I went on a tangent there."
"[Joe Rogan]: No, it's a good tangent. It's a good tangent because I think that oftentimes the pursuit is what's thrilling to people and the possibility that one day they'll be able to rest and that they'll have reached this goal."
"[INPUT]: That's the fundamental delusion, that there is something out there that will make me happy and --"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
[INPUT]: -- [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: The golden years.
"[INPUT]: There is, it's called death."
[Joe Rogan]: Oh.
[INPUT]: That'll take care of everything. That's the great leveler.
"[Joe Rogan]: But when people look at, particularly social media -- let's bring it back to that. When you see someone who -- you know, you see them posed in front of their mansion, with their beautiful car, and they're leaning against it with their designer clothes on, their expensive watch. I want that."
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: That's what I want.
[INPUT]: What you really want is freedom. You want freedom from your money problems.
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: And I think that's okay. So people -- once someone can solve their money problems, either by lowering their lifestyle or by making enough money, and, you know essentially, what you want to get everybody to the retirement. But not retirement in the, I'm 65 years old sitting, in a nursing home, collecting a check, retirement. Different definition. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow. Okay?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: When today is complete in and of itself, you're retired."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And so, how do you get there? Well, one is, you can have so much money saved up that just your passive income off of that without you having to lift a finger. Coverage your burn rate. Keep your burn rate low. Right? A second is, you just drive your burn rate down to zero. You become a monk. A third is, you're doing something you love. You enjoy it so much it's not about the money."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: So there are multiple ways to that path, but the most common is people just say, I need to make more money. And the kind of wealth creation that I talk about is about creating timeless principles and adapting yourself that making money won't be an issue, and you can do it by doing what you love. Right? Like we get into this model of, I must work for other people, working my way up the ladder. I must, like, do what that person is doing to make money. But really today in society, you get rewarded for creative work, for creating something brand new that society didn't even know yet that it wanted. That doesn't know how to get other than through you. So the most powerful moneymakers are actually individual brands, people like yourself or Elon or Kanye or Oprah or Trump, right? These are individual brands. Eponymous name brands who themselves are leverage. Like you are leveraged. You have podcast media going out to everybody, that's leveraged. The podcast work for you when you sleep. They have knowledge that nobody else has, which is your knowledge is the knowledge of being Joe Rogan. I mean, who else is a UFC fighter and a commentator at a podcast and a comedian and, you know, interesting all these things and knows all these people, can't replace you. So we have to pay you what you're worth, and --"
[Joe Rogan]: I never fought in the FCU.
"[INPUT]: Oh, you didn't? Okay. Sorry. Or you know, whatever. You're involved in that whole scene. You just have a unique set of skill-sets. So because of this unique what I call specific knowledge, because of the accountability that you have with your name, because the leverage that you have through your media, you're a money making machine. I'm sure at this point, I can make you start over tomorrow, wipe out your bank account. You'd be rich again in no time. Because you have all the skill-sets. So once people have those skill-sets, and the beauty is the way you've done it, is you don't have any competition. There's no substitution. If Joe Rogan were to disappear off the air tomorrow, it's not like random podcast number twelve would step in and fill that thing. No. It's just gone. So the way to get out of that competition trap is actually to be authentic. The way to retire is actually to find the thing that you know how to do better than anybody. And you know how to do that better because you love to do it. No one can compete with you if you love to do it. Be authentic and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some leverage, put your name on it, so you take the risks, but you gain the rewards. Have ownership and equity in what you do and then just crank it up."
"[Joe Rogan]: I think people have to be very careful to not get trapped along the way with things that you can afford with your current lifestyle, the way you're living and the way you're earning, but they're also imprisoning you and the fact that you are now going to have to work this 40 hour week job in order to get this thing that you can afford. But now you're saddled down to this job. You're not saving. You're not putting things in a good pla- and you're working for these things. Working for things as rewards --"
[INPUT]: Right.
[Joe Rogan]: -- is a real trap that a lot of people fall into.
[INPUT]: It's the biggest one. Nassim Taleb also says that under two great addictions; heroin and a monthly salary. And that's why you can't get rich [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Because, you know, when you start charging more and more for your time it's a slow upgrade loop, and then you upgrade your house, at the same time your car, at the same time you move in the neighborhood. You really also have to get used to ignoring your peers or upgrading or changing the definition of your peers."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: A lot of people here who are poor here, but they would be rich if they were living in Thailand and Bali. And if they had the luxury of a remotely doable job, they may want to be living there and saving up money."
"[Joe Rogan]: But the ignoring the peers is an issue, because the Keeping Up with the Joneses is a real phenomenon. Yeah envy makes the world go around. And then there's this other thing that people have to avoid even allowing their mind to think when they're hearing what you're saying. And all those logical fantastic advice there's these six dirty words, That's easy for you to say.."
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: That is a terrible trap.
"[INPUT]: And look, I grew up as a first generation immigrant in Jamaica Queens with zero money. Single mom, two kids, working day and night, go to school. You know. I wash dishes. I was working catering jobs. I was mowing lawns. I was working since the age of eleven on and off here and there. Then have two cents to rub together. You know. I had to borrow $400 to go to college, like, I was short $400."
[Joe Rogan]: 400.
[INPUT]: I had to find $400.
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
"[INPUT]: I didn't have it. You know, got rejected from a job at Dunkin Donuts. So like, okay, it's not to say that it's easy."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: It's not easy.
[Joe Rogan]: It's not easy.
[INPUT]: It actually really frickin hard.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: It is the hardest thing you will do. But it's also the rewarding thing. You know, look at the kids who are born rich, no meaning to their lives."
[Joe Rogan]: It's desirable place.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Your real resumé is just a catalogue of all your suffering. If I were to ask you to describe your real life to yourself, when you look back on your deathbed, you're gonna go back and say what are the interesting things I've done and it's all going to be around the sacrifices that you've made and the hard things that you did."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Anything you were given doesn't matter. You know, you have your four limbs, you have your brain, you have your head, you have your skin. That's all for granted. So you have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine one. Yes, struggle. It is hard. I'm not gonna say it's easy. It's really hard. But the tools are all available. It's all there."
"[Joe Rogan]: There's also there's these traps that people sort of establish in their own mind of giving themselves excuses or giving themselves insurmountable obstacles, insurmountable paths, victory."
[INPUT]: Victim mentality.
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's somebody else's fault. That's my skin-color's fault. That's the system's fault. Yeah. Those people are sinking. I feel bad for them. I want to shake them out of it and say, Actually, you can get out of it. You just have to stop thinking it's everybody else's fault."
[Joe Rogan]: You have to alter the perspective.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: But it's so difficult for people to do. It's one of the most difficult things for people to do is to change the way they approach reality itself.
"[INPUT]: At the end of the day, I do think, even despite what I said earlier, life is really a single player game. It's all going on in your head. You know, whatever you think you believe will very much shape your reality, both from what risks you take and what actions you perform, but also just everyday experience of reality. If you're walking down the street and you're judging everyone, you're like, I don't like that person because their skin color, I don't like that -- Oh, she's not attractive. That guy is fat. This person is a loser. Oh, who put this in my way. You know, the more you judge, the more you gonna separate yourself. And you'll feel good for an instant because you'll feel good about yourself. I'm better than that. But then you gonna feel lonely. And then you're just going to see negativity everywhere. The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad, right? You're born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences in stimulations and lights and colors and sounds, and then you die."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: And how you choose to interpret, that is up to you. You do have that choice. So this is what I meant, that happiness is a choice. If you believe it's a choice, then you can start working on it. And I can't tell you how to find it, because it's your own conditioning that are making you unhappy. So you have to unconditioned yourself. It's just like, I can't fix your eating habits for you. I can give you some general guidelines. but you got to go through the hard habit forming of how to eat right. But you have to believe it's possible and it is absolutely possible. I was miserable. I'm happy as a clam. And it's not just the money, I got there before the money."
[Joe Rogan]: You got happy before the money?
"[INPUT]: Mostly, yeah."
[Joe Rogan]: How did you get happy before the money.
"[INPUT]: I started getting older, you know. I just realized, like, life is short, I'm gonna die."
"[Joe Rogan]: Again. Try it, right?"
[INPUT]: Try it. Try it.
[Joe Rogan]: Anyways.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Well, Confucius had a great saying that, you know, Every man has two lives. And the second starts when he realizes he has just one."
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
"[INPUT]: And I read that. It was one of those book dropping lines. You know, it's like mic drop. Confucius had a lot of mic drops."
[Joe Rogan]: Confucius is a bad motherfucker.
[INPUT]: He was.
[Joe Rogan]: That's a crazy one.
"[INPUT]: That was a great one. Or another one is, Next time you get sick -- You know, because everybody may get sick every now and then. It's like, A happy person wants ten thousand things, a sick person just wants one thing. Right? So it's your unlimited desires that are clouding your peace, your happiness, have desires. You're a biological creature, stands up and says, I can do something. I move. I resist. I live. But just be very careful about your desires. This is the oldest most trite wisdom, desire is suffering. That's what it means, right? Every desire you have is an access where you will suffer. So just don't focus on more than one desire at a time. The universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing and you focus on that, you'll get it. But everything else, you got to let go."
[Joe Rogan]: Did you make a gradual shift to happiness or was it a radical change?
[INPUT]: It's ongoing. It's gradual. Everyday gets better.
[Joe Rogan]: So you were happier today than you were a month ago.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
[Joe Rogan]: Allegedly.
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Yeah, I'm very happy these days. Deliriously so. It's actually hard for me to hang out with normal people."
[Joe Rogan]: Really?
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: So you've made a significant shift over the period of like, how many years?"
[INPUT]: Probably about eight years.
[Joe Rogan]: Eight years.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Wow. And is this something that you've pursued through certain books or is it just like you've made an understanding or gained an understanding in your own mind, and then started pursuing it based on an understanding?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah, it's very, very personal. It's basically, you have to decide it's a priority. And then I tried every hack I possibly could. I used -- to you know, I tried all the -- I tried meditation, I tried witnessing, you know, I even tried [inaudible 1[Joe Rogan]: How did it feel?"
"[INPUT]: It was it turned me from a pessimist to an optimist, but I didn't like the physical side effects nor did I want to be in a drug for sustained basis. So I dropped it, and I felt --"
"[Joe Rogan]: So, it did turn you into an optimist?"
[INPUT]: Yes.
[Joe Rogan]: Interesting.
"[INPUT]: At the time, I used to be a pessimist. Yeah. I started doing things like I would start looking at the -- you know, in every moment and everything that happens, you can look on the bright side of something, right? And so I used to do that forcibly and then I trained it until it became second nature. So for example, like a friend of my wife's was over, and she -- when we were dating, and she took all these photos, she took like hundreds of photos, and then she sends them all to us. And my immediate reaction was like, Why are you dumping hundreds of photos on my phone? I don't need hundreds of photos. Have some judgment."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: That was my immediate reaction. And then I could say, Actually, how nice of her. She sent me hundreds of photos. I could pick the one that I'd like. Right? There are two ways of seeing almost everything."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: There are few things that are like high suffering so you can't do that, other than just saying, Well, this is a teacher. Right? But I slowly work through every negative judgment that I had until I saw the positive. and that second nature to me. I also realized that like what you want is you want to clear minds, you want to let go of thoughts. Happy thoughts disappear out ahead automatically, very easy to let go of them. Negative thoughts linger. So if you interpret the negative, the positive and everything very quickly, you let it go. Right? You let it go much faster. Simple hacks get more sunlight, right? Learn to smile more. Learn to hug more these things actually released serotonin in reverse. They aren't just outward signals of being happy. They're actually feedback loops to being happy. Spend more time in nature. You know, these are obvious. Watch your mind. Watch your mind all day long. Watch what it does, not judge it, not try to control it, but you can meditate 24/7. Meditation is not a sit down, close your eyes activity. Meditation is just basically watching your own thoughts like you would watch anything else in the outside world, and say, Why am I having that thought? Does that serve me anymore? Is that conditioning from when I was 10 years old? Like, for example, getting ready for this podcast."
[Joe Rogan]: You got ready?
[INPUT]: I didn't.
[Joe Rogan]: Oh good.
[INPUT]: But I did. But I did. But I did.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, you did."
"[INPUT]: I couldn't help it. And what happened was the few days leading up to this, my mind was just running. And normally my mind is pretty calm, and it was just running and running and running. And every thought I would have, I would imagine me saying it to you. My brain couldn't help but rehearse what it's doing. It's just rehearsing all the time to talk to you. And then I was even rehearsing -- rehearse telling you about the rehearsal. Right? So it was all playing all these meta-games. And I was like, Shut up. Stop it. What is going on? And it took me a while to figure out. Oh yeah. You know what it is. When I was a kid in Queens and I had no money and I had nothing, and I needed to save myself, the way I got out was by sounding smart. Not being smart, sounding smart. That was the skill I perfected. So I am hardwired to always rehearse things so I will sound smart. It's a disease that keeps me from being happy. But when you see that, when you realize that, when you understand something, then it naturally calms you down. So after that, I stop rehearsing as much."
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
[INPUT]: But is still a trained habit.
"[Joe Rogan]: That is a really interesting point that you want to sound smart. Many people do that and especially young people. When you see someone who is smart or someone who appears smart, they say smart things. You kind of want to sound smart. I want people to think about me the same way I think about that person."
"[INPUT]: That is my disease. That is my feeling. It is what clutters my mind. The thing I have to ask myself now is, if I can -- Would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn't ever tell anybody about it? That's how I know it's real. That's how I know something I actually want."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's a common thing though. I know I suffered from that when I was young, the desire to sound smart. It's very common."
"[INPUT]: Well, all of us start out -- you know, everything you're a winner now in your life, it's because you were a loser at some point."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: If you had gotten all the girls, if you had all the money, if you had everything you want, you're a good looking and in junior/higher high school, you wouldn't have done anything with your life. And you would have peaked early. It's like the Bruce Springsteen Glory Days song, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
"[INPUT]: You were to marry your high school sweetheart. You'd be living in your hometown. You know, you'd be a manager at the local McDonald's, whatever that first dream job you had. Thank God, we didn't all get what we wanted when we were young."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: Or we would be trapped in that. So you have to be able to break out of where you came from. I don't know where I was going.
[Joe Rogan]: That is interesting too about people who peaked too early.
[INPUT]: Yeah.
"[Joe Rogan]: Or maybe those people that peaked too early can do the Elon Musk thing, and just abandon it and start something new, and then learn that the joys of sucking at something."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And actually, in our profession especially, when your high visibility. The problem with peaking is that you then get drowned in death of a thousand cuts. People have expectations of you. Hey, Joe, can you come to my event? Hey, Joe, can you look at my business plan? Hey, Joe, can give me advice in this? Can you, you know, talk to my friend? Can you come in this podcast. You're just being assaulted all the time with inbound opportunities. So you have no time to start over with anything. So you have to ruthlessly, ruthlessly disappoint everybody."
[Joe Rogan]: Yes.
"[INPUT]: Eliminate and clear your schedule. Drop all the meetings, not even respond to the e-mails, is the only way you can be able to start over with anything."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah. We talked about this and I'd love your approach to meetings.
[INPUT]: I hate meetings.
"[Joe Rogan]: If not life or death -- I'm the same way. I avoided a good one recently and this was someone that was just tracking me down as a high profile person in a big organization and I'm like, Can we just talk in the phone? Then we talked on the phone. There was nothing to say. It was just -- they wanted to get me in the office and come down."
"[INPUT]: Yeah. And meetings should really be phone calls, phone calls should be e-mails."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: And e-mails should just be text. Right?
"[Joe Rogan]: Many of them, right?"
"[INPUT]: With meetings -- I mean, I despise meetings. I used to own the domain. I don't do coffee dot com. I eventually let it go, but I used to respond from default, I don't do coffee, you know."
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, that's hilarious."
"[INPUT]: It is a little bit of a jerk move, but really where it comes from is when I was young, one of my principles was, I knew I had to make money. It was my overwhelming desire. And one of the things I did was I said, Okay, I'm never gonna be worth more than what I think I'm worth. No one's gonna pay me more than what I think I'm worth. So what am I worth? So I picked an hourly rate for myself that I was worth. And I said I'm never gonna squander my time for less than this. Original is 500 bucks an hour, then I upgrade to 5,000 bucks an hour. You know, it's ludicrous. But pick an aspirational hourly rate. Aspirational. It has to be a little ludicrous. And then what I would do is if I have to return something, I'm standing in line to return something and it's below my hourly rate, I'll throw it away. If I have to -- or give it away."
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
"[INPUT]: If I have to do some task and I can hire somebody to do it for less than my hourly rate I would hire them. And so I just became extremely jealous of my time. Which doesn't mean you can't have fun, rest, leisure, spending time with your friends and family. That's all great. Don't count that. But if you're doing anything you don't want to do -- which is the definition of work. It's a set of things that you have to do that you don't want to do. If you're working, it better be for your hourly rate. Otherwise don't do the work. And so once it came out of that, then it just raise the cost of meetings. The cost of meetings is so high, especially given all the people who are in there, right? One person is talking, seven people listening, you're literally just dying an hour at a time. So you have to just drop non-urgent meetings or figure out how to be more efficient with them if you gonna do anything great. The extreme example is business travel. Getting on a plane to fly halfway around the world for one meeting, which never amounts to anything. And then like wasting your whole little life there and then flying back. So about five years ago I resolved, I am never gonna travel for business."
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
"[INPUT]: And I haven't traveled for business since. I only travel if the travel experience will be so entertaining and joyous because I have friends or to place I want to see or whatever, that it will be complete in and of itself. Because I know that whatever the business meeting I came from, it's never worth it."
[Joe Rogan]: Wow.
"[INPUT]: And actually that principle applies larger than just travel. It applies to life in general. This -- One of the secrets to happiness is to really embrace what you're doing in that moment. That's trite. But where that where that comes from is saying, I only want to do actions that are complete in and of themselves, right? If I'm looking for some ulterior motive down the line, it's not gonna materialize. And if you think it is, maybe -- even if it does, it'll be pretty short lived. Anything you want in your life, whether the car or whether it's a girl or there's plenty, when you got it, a year later, you're back to zero. Your brain had hedonically adapted to it, and you were looking for the next thing."
"[Joe Rogan]: That's a great statement, hedonically adapted. That is what happens to people. You get accustomed to whatever it is. I realize that when I first got a new apartment, it was a nice apartment. After a while I got used to it. I was like, Oh, okay. This is just an apartment it's just where I live. I'm used to it. It's nice but I'm used to it."
"[INPUT]: Yeah, we all go through this learning. It's, you know, it's riding the Ferris Wheel of Life. It's like you get out the bottom like I want to get the top. That's so exciting. You ride it up, you get a little dopamine rush and get little serotonin. Then you ride it back down as that wears off and you need another high. Then you ride it back up and ride it back down. In fact the more highs you get, the harder it gets to go around the wheel, the more bored you get of it, the harder it goes to go back up."
"[Joe Rogan]: So what lights your fire now? Like, what gets you motivated to do things into act?"
[INPUT]: Art.
[Joe Rogan]: Art?
[INPUT]: This is art.
"[Joe Rogan]: Oh, okay."
"[INPUT]: Art is this creativity. It's just, anything that's done for its own sake. So what are the things that are done for their own sake? There's nothing beyond. Loving somebody, creating something, playing, art -- to me, creating business is a play. I create businesses early stage because it's fun, because I'm into the product. Even when I invest, it's because I like the people, I like hanging out with them, I learn from them and I think the product is really cool. So these days, I will pass on all kinds of great investments because I'm like I just -- the product's not interesting, it's boring. I'm not gonna learn anything."
[Joe Rogan]: That's a beautiful luxury.
"[INPUT]: It is a luxury. Art and learning, yeah. It is a luxury -- these are not 100% or 0 things, right?"
[Joe Rogan]: Right.
[INPUT]: You can in your life start moving more and more towards that.
[Joe Rogan]: Right. But it's a goal.
"[INPUT]: It's a goal. When I was younger, I used to be so desperate to make money that I would done anything. If you'd shown up and said, Hey, I got a sewage trucking business and you're going to go into that, I said, Great, let's do it. I want to make money. Thank God no one gave me that opportunity. I'm glad that it went down the road of technology and science which I genuinely enjoy. And so I got to combine my vocation and my avocation. I mean, what are you doing? You're playing. You're having fun."
[Joe Rogan]: Yeah.
[INPUT]: You're doing art. You're not working.
"[Joe Rogan]: No. That's what I would say when people say I work hard. I'm like, Sorta, not really."
"[INPUT]: I'm always working but it looks like work to them but it feels like play to me. And that's how I know no one can compete with me on it, because I'm just playing 16 hours a day. And if they want to compete with me, and they're gonna work, they're gonna lose, because they're not gonna do it 16 hours a day, seven days a week."
"[Joe Rogan]: Listen, man. There are some gems of wisdom in this conversation and I hope people pull things out of this and apply them to their own life. And I'm certainly going to listen to you again and try to apply some of this to my own life, stuff that I'm not already applying. But I really appreciate your time and I really appreciate you coming in here."
[INPUT]: Thanks for having me.
"[Joe Rogan]: And please tell people your small little podcast, it's just The Naval Podcast, right?"
"[INPUT]: Yeah. Best way to find me is on Twitter, actually."
[Joe Rogan]: Okay.
[INPUT]: I'm just @naval. Then I have a website; @nav.al. I have a youtube channel; Naval. And I have a podcast; Naval. that's it.
"[Joe Rogan]: Well, thank you very much. Thank you."
"[INPUT]: Thank you, brother."
"[Joe Rogan]: I really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye, everybody."
